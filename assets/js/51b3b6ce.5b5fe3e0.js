Ha, the park had spinny things, bouncy things, and more. I played badmintin, and played on playstructures and stuff. Now-a-days, I feel like I know everyone. After all, there are only 100 8th graders at my school. At my past school there were 300, and I knew more than 90% of them. Meeting people becomes easier each time you do it.

I don't mean being esy on yourself, you need to hate yourself to love yourself. You need opposites for the other to be an opposite. You see, exersice, eat good, and other things, they are all good qualities. My teacher asked my classmate to be leader of a class game, they were pathetic, so much so I burned inside about how poorly they did it. I know I could have done a better job, they were rude, bad at being a leader, and everything. But I don't always need to be a leader, supporting is an equally important job. I know I could have done better though, it hurts to see someone being so bad at something, when I could have done it for them. But that in itself is stupid, so my point of contention is just to be better. Be better, once your better, compare yourself endlessly till you lose your mind.

If your unhappy about something about yourself, try to fix it. No one is perfect, perfection is infinite. But we can strive to reach infinity, just as numbers do. I strive for perfection, because I need peace of mind. "Am I the best? Am I better than that? Can I do that?" To combat this, just say yes in your mind.

Yeah... if you're unlucky enough to be in a group of girls who are a burden, just do it, whatever the take may be, just do it. So what if they don't help? They get under your skin?

I've met people who I've thought were disgraces to the human race, girls who I thought don't have any reason to exist, guys who I've thought were pathetic and dirty. Some girls just act dirty, like bags of meat fleash and bones. Dirty means, like without grace (poise), shameful. The way people act determines a lot, expessially for girls. A guy can get away with it if they are strong enough in other area's. But I don't care how pretty you are, if you act without grace, you are disgusting. A basic sense of commons should be to act with dignity, rather even self esteeem prevents such stupidity, but selfevidently it's careless to say everyone is good enough.

My dad bet me $80 I coulden't block his soccer kick, he kicked such a straight an easy to block shot. But when I kicked it, it rolled off my foot and went in the goal, damn. Anyways, then he decided to raise the stakes. The stakes were raised to; $500 if I blocked his shot, but if I blocked it, I had to do 1 task of his asking. I declined, as I do not need to money, what use do I have for $500? I have money, though it's far less than $500, I have enough. I do not need $500, if I needed it, I would've took the bet. But my pride is worth more than $500, but was this ever a question of ego? No, no it wasnt, I simply do not need it. What kind of task would he ask of me? I would rather not take the chance, \"it can't be that bad\". Yeah, the task he could ask of me would probably be not bad, but I don't care, I'm not taking the chance. Moreover I do not need the $500, even if it would be nice to have if such occasion rose that needed $500. But as of now, I simply do not need it, and why would I take $500 from my own father.

This situation could be a death sentence in a hostile environment, so to combat this, you must be able to crawl on your elbows (move). If you can't, you die, and if you can you survive you pass on genes. The ones who survive reproduce and pass on their genes, which would make people with the ability to elbow crawl more common, as the ones who couldn't elbow crawled died out, leaving less of those type of people. And if we take this a step further, by making the environment have a harsh terrain, we could \"force\" them to evolve in a way that solves the need for protection of the elbow while crawling on the rough ground. So, they would die if their elbows broke while crawling, as they would get caught by predators. So to combat this, they must pray that someone is born with an elbow protecting trait such as the elbow cap.
