If the driving gear is the smallest it would go slower but stronger, based on our data the force projected onto the not driving gear was equal. But since the gear is smaller, it would have many more rotations. So when big spins once, little would spin many times. The car itself would be made out of wheels, wood, battery, and gears. The gears were connected to the wheel, so when gear spun so did wheel, this caused the car to go forward. Thus it was displaced, it moved according to our data 22 seconds in the north direction, it was displaced 22 seconds north. We could not measure it because you asked our group not to, as our car went too far. So the force determines the work of the spinning object, and the more it spins, and the more torpe to weight ratio it has, the further and faster it will go. And how far it goes is how far the object was displaced. Force -> (work) -> Displacement. How much it was displaced is the work acted upon the object, how much force was put in can determine the displacement of the object, our car. Since the gears were attached to the wheels any force acted upon them by way of gears would be transferred (work) to the rotation/acceleration of the wheels, causing the car to move."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I dont know if this is correct, but it is what I understood of our lesson in class.
