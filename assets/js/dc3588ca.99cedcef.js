I was not opposed to this, because it was for good cause, I was just surprised by the sudden change(s). Sometimes, I\'d go up to say my part, only for a teacher to say a lengthy speach. The speeches were all great, all of thanks and admiration. I had fun, I\'m saying it a lot. At first, when I walked into the concert area, me and my co-hostess were the only ones there. In a room full of people we dont know, we just sat at the front, in front of all those people, just re-reading out scripts (sorta came in handy). I didn\'t feel nervous, why? Because I\'d been standing around in front of the audiance as their sole source of attention, and had gotten used to it. My nervusness was replaced by the willingness to do good. Long-story-shot, it went well. I had got much praise from many teachers, saying I have a radio voice, and "it was deep and cool".

I do not want to hurt any girls feelings by just rejecting them. So what do I do? Just keep walking, and continue on. I try my best to be nice, and be a good person. That makes people like me, girls included. To hurt, or not to hurt someones feeling depend on you. I make bad choices all the time, but I try. I know this may seem like I'm bragging, but being a good person never leads you wrong. If your strong, and are a good man, everyone will like you. Or they'll be forced to respect you as you have somethign they don't, the will to be a great person. You see someone doing something kind, that you wouldent have, you would be filled with either respect or mockery of them. If my friends ask me to do something, or help, I'll help. I support, with the hopes of being supported in return. You get everything by giving I guess? I give, to get support. This works, as I respect myself for making good choices some would not. To share your food, is not to go hungry. It is to prevent someone else from hunger, while keeping your own craving satified. Sharing is caring, no, you must care to share. If you do not, don't share. Share when you care, like if someone needs money to buy a coke.

Everyone likes the company of good people, if they don't, that means they aren't good people. I used to have really bad friends in california, smoking, vaping, gangs, fights, other things.

I'm not able to explain it too well, but improvment is difficult if you find it as such. Exersicing is easy, just simply exersice, or study. It's not erroneous to say that improvment is based on you (the culmination of everything around and inside you). It's weird, because I am also a thing subject to it's envierment. The utopia of pinnicale strength, brains, charizma, eludes most (if not all). What pinnicale to I strive for? The pinnicale of life, would that be death? No, I'd say it would be creation, the art of being. I wan't to create, a thought came to mind, as we all wan't to create (or destroy, if that's whats intrests you).

So at the start, we feel good? Not nessecarily, as someone could wan't to improve from feeling really bad about their own weakness. My ambivalence about this is just, meaningful. See, somone could feel bad, then exersice to feel better. But what if when they exerisce they relise they cannot even do one pushup? Would they sink, and reach the nadir? Maybe, this would mean that you feel better when you start, than when you relise your weak? Circumstances differ, it's apocryphal to say that anomalies are very rare. You exersice to become stronger, wheather it be in strength or in strength in your own belief of youself being \"strong\". An anomaly would be somoene (in this case) who feels worse before starting to exersice. I mean relising your weak would be devastating, but someone with strong will woujld persevere.

So some more talking later and it didn't seem like they had any intention of fighting, so I asked my friend to apologise (because honeslty being racist is bad). He did not, and said he already apologised. So then the less big guy, just straight up left, and the bigger guy told he accepts the apology and hurried away.

They more so just wan't you to find your passion, and learn a little of everything, instead of learning solely smart stuff. It is different, it suits some people, and doesn't suit others. There is ZERO homework, they just do not give homework. No one has ever heard of doing work at home, or studying. When I talk about, how I'm gonna study. \"Study what? There's no test\", you don'y need there to be a test to STUDY, common sense. But, I guess barely anyone studies because there is no homework so no study habits.

We went to our hotel, ate a small deli. It was very homey, and I loved it, like I would go there ever day because of how amazing it was. It was run by an elderly couple, the whole vibe was, \"You Gave Me Your Word X Rises The Moon by Zoldyc\". It was sad they were in such a small area, but it was just awesome. I enjoyed a hotdog and chicken'n'rice soup. We then went to stanly park, it was just incredible, there was so much open space and grass. I laid down on the grass and slept for a good (more than an) hour. I got up and watched my brother play at the water thingy there. We then went and walked along the seawall, we saw a dragin statue. Afterwards, we headed to canada place (fly over canada thing), it was breathtaking, like insanely so. I thought it would be fake, but the realism and uality of it was stunnnig. I felt as if I was actully soaring through canada, I even felt anxious. Truly a experiance of a lifetime, I 100% enjoyed it, and would pay a $100 to see it again, that feeling was alsmot akin to flying in an airplane. I forgot to mention, but before we went ti the deli, we also bought medicine from the small pharmacy next to the deli. It was a small (3 inch or so) bottle of green pills. I had one before eating in the deli, and like 2 more during the day. How did we get too all of these places when we did not have a car? well we rented one, it was a cool genesis car 2024 Genesis ALTA WHITE G80 (amazing, the car looked so cool, up close it looks so fancy but not too much, it is a classy car). The inside had some buttons, though not too many, and it the tech it had was stunning, and so usefull, blindspot coverage, parking assist, it was amazing. I want one of these when I'm older, though they cost a pretty penny. They cost around $50k, which is less than a tesla, but still expensive. We were supposed to get a SUV from the rental shop, but they ran out, so they gave us this (more expensive) car. I loved it, so much I felt at home it the car, I have a new dream car, yes it was that good of a car. Just amazing, even now I am in awe of how smooth the steering (per my dads words and experiance) and driveing felt. My dad said after driving the car, our 2015 Toyota Prius felt hard to steer. But the 2015 Toyota Prius is just also a super reliable car, with double the milage of the (luxary version) genisis and amazing driving."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Moving on, we came back to the hotel and just relaxed, then went to buy chipotle. I have not eaten a chipotle in a year now (SADLY). We went there, got food, came back. I have to say, best tasting food ever (aside from the food truck by california, san mateo high school, Martin Luther King Jr. Park, they serve 12+ inch long and 3 inch wide burrito's). I don't know why, but every other (junk, hispanic) food prior to this tasted mediocre (I did like quesada though). The quality is out of this world, I have learned much from this trip. That chipotle is a privilage, and it just amazing.
