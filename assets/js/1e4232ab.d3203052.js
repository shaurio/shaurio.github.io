A haploid cell is where the cell only has one copy of the parent cell. Ova has 13 pairs of chromosomes, the sperm has 13 pairs of chromosomes too. They both get together to have in total 23 pairs, these 23 pairs are responsible for the human. You know, us. One half, plus another halve. Equals 1 whole doesn't it? Haploids are halves, diploid is full/whole. I mean thats not totally acurate but, somewhat true yes. Human gametes are the egg and sperm cell.
