If atoms (somtimes) attract other atoms, and molecules attract other molecules, then couldn't someone create a substance that attracts radiation? Like if there is a radiation zone, you could spray something in the air that would cause the radiation molecules to stick to the substance in the air, then drop to the floor becuase it's so heavy. From this point, we could just vacume up the radiation that has clumped together with the substance, and fallen to the ground. But how can we tell what's radiation, and whats not? After all these are small molecules! Well, we could make the substance have glowing properties, so when a bunch of this substance clumps together with the radiation, it glows!"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'I do believe this is possible, becuase the same thing was done with water, refer to mark rober\'s experiment. They used a substance that clumped together with the dirt floating around in the water, which made it too heavy to float. I believe this is possible with air, as air works opposite of water (in my personal opinion). To recap, make a substance that seeks out (or soemthign else) radiation, then spray it at raidiation to test any hypothesi you have. Back to how we will clean up the fallen radiation, the glowing substance will be visible in large quantities, so it should be like small shiny glitter all over the ground. Just take a vaccume, and vaccume up all the glowing green "glitter" on the ground. Repeat this procces many times.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Another way I believe could (more likely) work, is one where we utilize planes.

Well first, how to viruses work, and how can we "destroy" them? A virus gets inside a persons body, then sticks onto a cell, then injects the DNA or RNA it has inside the cell. This means the virus will reproduce inside the cell, where it could leave and reproduce in more, spreading exponentially. So how to we destroy something so similar to cockroaches inside our body?

By destroying their function; oxidising or something destorys their body to an extent, and alchohol also works. Don't take my word for it, I still don't know how killing a virus works. But moving on, we as humans to lab tests to see what could stop viruses, so why can't A.I do it too? We could ask the A.I to run tests millions of times faster and more quantity or tests.
