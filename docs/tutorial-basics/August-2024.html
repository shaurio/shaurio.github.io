<p>It is now August, July was SO much fun. I had summer school, which I really enojyed.</p>

<p>Still on my trip, in quebec. Went to this Place Versalli or something mall, it was pretty cool. The water fountan decoration shot out water very high. Other than that we roamed the mall, it was a good mall, but the floor quality was amazing.</p>
<p>Did some more things, and during this stay I read a lot of the book I recently purchased, it is very intresting. It gave me a new perspective on evolution, past and presently tied in with that of a biological stand point; into more of ideas and humanities innovations, such as fantasy. At no time do you find yourself board, as it explains impact, cause, relation, and eveyrthing that follows; all of it is tied together with real examples.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m talking about Sapiens, by Yuval Noah Harari. I asked chat gpt to evaluate:</p>
<p>&quot;I read a lot of the book I recently purchased, it is very intresting. It gave me a new perspective on evolution, past and presently tied in with that of a biological stand point; into more of ideas and humanities innovations, such as fantasy. &quot;</p>
<p>It gave me exactly the answer I was looking for, which was how my view of the book could be understood; it captured that perfectly. It said that which I wished to convey with words, understood.</p>
<p>Whatever, writing in such manner is honestly quite fun, it seems to approach a point of prevaricating with which is not equivocal or ambigious in any notion of sense as I&#x27;ve writen it. I do understand that as such some will not understand, yet in my doing so there are multitudes of benifits; they range from my own learning and understanding of words and scentance structure, and also the readers own understanding of such pretaining to my prior vindication, or rather indication of my nuanced style of writing.</p>
<p>Whew, that was dumb. But very fun, ignore my previous &quot;vindication&quot; of why I write like that sometimes. Playing around with grammer and meaning is facinating; it can lead to ambiguos scentances, equivocal in nature, but deepening in thought and meaning. One day I would wish to have such linguistic and artful writing prowess as Darwin, as he explains and with full clarity topics that he wishes to explain; in fact sometimes he seems unquestionable with his explanations, since he explains things very well.</p>
<p>Moving on, I slept. I wrote all this on aug 4th.</p>

<p>Drove back home, felt relaxed. Five minutes after I got back, my friend texted me if I could play Rocket League, I said yes. Rocket League is one, if not my favourite game. We played fir a while, with a friend of his (heatseeker, duper fun). His name was ma-nu-je, sounded out, I dont know how to spell his name.</p>
<p>Kinda just relaxed today.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="august-4th">August 4th<a href="#august-4th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to August 4th" title="Direct link to August 4th">​</a></h3>
<p>Today similarily I relaxed, forgot to mention but I exersiced both yesterday and today.</p>
<p>I did some studying, though not much at all, rather I wouldn&#x27;t even count it. I relaxed and hung out with my family for the most part; played RL with my whole family (mom, dad, little brother, and me). I forced my little brother to study, since that is what a good brother does. I told him I&#x27;d take away his I-pad if he does not do Khanacedemy. He did for 30 minutes, then we played RL. He figured out how to do 52 x 63, not bad I guess.</p>
<p>Looked at photos of my dad and mom when they were younger. My dad was &quot;heavier&quot;, and my mom was more slender. Now it is the oposite, though insignificant in looks. My dad has lost some weight, my mom is not skinny, but not fat or chubby either. My dad is not fat either, never was. Similarily, I do not plan on becoming fat, <em>shudder</em>. I love feeling like, good, and healthy, and athletic. Being healthy is the only thing that matters in life, it determines your quality of life. You cannot have kids if your too unhealthy, or run, or do anything. Being fat is something I believe if possible to avoid, then avoid it. You may be content being chubby/flabby/fat, but think of how good it would feel to have a six pack? Or evan just a regular healthy body, though having too much muscle could make you look fat (idk, I dunno).</p>
<p>Moving on, I will relax for some time.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="august-5th">August 5th<a href="#august-5th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to August 5th" title="Direct link to August 5th">​</a></h3>
<p>Don&#x27;t know when I woke up, but I have been studying ever since, and it is bright outside now. Perhaps I&#x27;ve been at it for 30 minutes to an hour now. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll study all too much today, as my parents have taken off from work so we can all spend time with each other today. From here on they will be busy again, leading me to study all day long as it is enjoyable. Remember that scheduel I made on july 7th? Well english till lunch, math till 5:00, then biology from then on. I will now follow that schedule roughly, exersice and read my cool book at my leasuire, or when I need a break. A break is only neccsary if I&#x27;m too tired or something to work productively, then I might as well relax to regain my former energy; studying can be enervating at times, but at most it is a way to escape parochial views on any subject.</p>
<p>Currently 8:15 or so, never mind 8:18. I am still doing grammer (studying), and I have learned some words here and there, some structure, and also some ways of making inferences. It has gotten very bright outside, as my window betreys the outside worlds bright early morning glory. My feet kept aside the window are illuminated by the concurrent light pouring in from the window.</p>
<p>Ate breakfast, then went to go buy coffee, think I&#x27;ll take a break from it though. Then studied, but got sidetracked and did some other things. Ate lunch, then did some more things, some more things. I honestly don&#x27;t remember what I did. But I spent a couple hours teaching my brother.</p>
<p>This was after my dad spent some time teaching him, he cried cause my dad told him to be a champion not a loser. My brother may not be the brightest, or the strongest, but what&#x27;s stopping him from it? Nothing, nothing at all. So I&#x27;ve brought it upon myself, because, I&#x27;m sure you can use contex to infer some reason why.</p>
<p>Slept</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="august-6th">August 6th<a href="#august-6th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to August 6th" title="Direct link to August 6th">​</a></h3>
<p>I plan on going to play with my friends at my highschool from 2:30 to 4:30. Then at another park at 4:30 till whenever I want to come home. There has been an amber alert yesterday, so my parents want me to be safe, and I will.</p>
<p>Woke up and talked to my friends, texted them through phone number. It is a plan that is solid. I just made my brother answer 340436 - 10437 and he got 29999 and 329999. Maybe he is still learning.</p>
<p>Currently 9:50, got back home at 8:40, at dinner imediatly after.</p>
<p>Bare with me, everything hurts, all my fingers and muscles hurt; typing hurts.</p>
<p>So, studied for a bit, did some things like teaching my brother. Then ate lunch, after lunch I played RL with my friend for some 15 minutes. Then headed to the highschool, since it was raining I met up with the friends at a close by Circle K. We bought coffee from there, it was good, so are the cookies. Then we left to the field at huron, and played soccer till my good friend Ratan came, we then continued to play till 4:09. At 4:10 we went to the pizza place, I bought a large pizza for $14, I think it is well priced for the size; I&#x27;m not saying $14 is a small amount, I am merely saying it is priced competively, which is good.</p>
<p>We ate till like 5:00, then went to a park to play some more soccer, since the field at our highschool is too muddy. Once we got there, we were met with artificial grass and not muddy grass (though it was commensurate with the slipperiness at our &quot;to-be&quot; highschool). We played till 8:30, some 19-21 year olds joined us, then it got really intresting. It was so much fun, I played as goalie and defender, I did pretty damn good (not just my opinion). This gave a valuable chance to practice being goalie, I&#x27;d say it was everything I&#x27;d hoped for, and was just very fun.</p>
<p>Around 5:40 or so a girl joined us, a group of maybe 15 guys; she was the only girl there. Normally this would be cool, since having a girl play with us aint bad, maybe she could even lighten up the atmosphere? This sadly did not happen, as no one liked her, myself included. She joined us to show off that she went to an acedemy and is better than us, that&#x27;s it. Now listen carefully, what she had hoped for did not happen, she had made herself a laughing stock, we all laughed at how bad she was. Now listen even more carefully, we did not laugh solely because she was bad, that would be horrible/rude. We laughed because she talked a big game, but failed to deliver. Now so what if she talked a big game? Well she was rude to everyone, evan the 9 year olds who were playing with us. This was unexeptable, she would not stop talking, like at all, she would run her mouth like a horse. She would not stop saying &quot;pass&quot;, but when passed to she never could keep the ball, so why pass? Now it is not simply somone took the ball from her, she just couldent properly recieve a pass. Now why am I saying this? Well if you&#x27;re a girl reading this, remember the only things guys care about are their own perceptions of you.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;What? That doesn&#x27;t make sense!&quot;</li>
<li>Well if a guy sees you as nice, thats a good thing</li>
<li>&quot;Okay.. but so what?&quot;</li>
<li>If they see you as rude, that is a bad thing</li>
<li>&quot;So?&quot;</li>
<li>You don&#x27;t want guys, if not people in general to view you as bad, or they will treat you with disdain!</li>
<li>&quot;Really? So I should do attractive things to be attractive?&quot;</li>
<li>Yes, this goes for guys too, though what the definition of attractive is differs from person-to-person.</li>
<li>&quot;But what if I don&#x27;t want any guy to like me, like I don&#x27;t have a crush on anyone?&quot;</li>
<li>So what? Guys are people who you talk to on a daily basis, never mind, not just guys, people in general like attractive things!</li>
<li>&quot;I guess that makes sense, so if I want to be shown contempt, I should act without grace?&quot;</li>
<li>Yes, and vice-verse for the opposite effect.</li>
<li>&quot;Incredible!&quot;</li>
<li>Yes, though it&#x27;s up to you if you want to pursue being an attractive human being.</li>
<li>&quot;What are some attractive traits people could posses?&quot;</li>
<li>Exersizing, talking politely, also being charismatic. One thing, this ties in with charisma, being smart.</li>
<li>&quot;Why do I want to be attractive, who cares? Right?&quot;</li>
<li>No, it is important, as it makes your life easier, much much easier.</li>
<li>&quot;Why?&quot;</li>
<li>Why do you think?</li>
<li>&quot;..Um, becuase you wont be treated with disdain?&quot;</li>
<li>Something like that, yeah.</li>
<li>&quot;Okay, I will do some self-reflection now.&quot;</li>
<li>Thats a good thing, a very good thing!</li>
<li>&quot;...&quot;</li>
<li>They left already huh.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, that was an example, or something along those lines. Now why does this matter? Well being attractive is great, if you arent the most good looking person, be strong, be smart, be wise, be charismatic (sensefully wise), or some other thing. If you can&#x27;t be good at one thing, do another, or another, or even another! But if possible, become all of that and more, but why? To enjoy things that are elusive to most others, such as hanging out with friends, or being the best version of youself.</p>
<p>What is my point? I&#x27;m not sure, just be a better human?</p>

<p>Still in awe of how it is already august, crazy how time flies. Anyways, I woke up early, played RL, then am now gonna study.</p>
<p><em>Currently 1:43 on aug 9th, hadn&#x27;t relized I&#x27;d forgotten to write in here; I just assumed I did. Anyways, I kinda relaxed for aug 7th and 8th. I played with my younger brother and just played video games.</em></p>

<p>I had this really odd feeling, an emptyiness, though I couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was. I felt so at peace, like I hadn&#x27;t any emotions. Then it struck me, perhaps I was at peace? It all felt so dull, I had no qualms, no problems to worry about, just me.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="august-9th">August 9th<a href="#august-9th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to August 9th" title="Direct link to August 9th">​</a></h3>
<p>After yesterday, I relise that I need to stay busy, so I don&#x27;t become bored. It wasn&#x27;t a bad feeling though, being devoid of any gerviances, I just didn&#x27;t regret anything, rather I accepted everything moved on. But that&#x27;s not what I want to do, I have a goal, to distinguish myself I my mind. To be a great man, the goal since which has been on my mind for a long time. Yesterday, as I was playing with my younger brother outside, I felt truely old. Those who I had looked up to in the past were now younger than me in respect to my memories with them at the time. It was a wierd feeling, but I felt that I&#x27;d grown up, I felt different. Maybe I&#x27;d gained a new level of thinking, as In felt &quot;enlightened&quot;. My emotions didn&#x27;t sway me as much, a feeling which seemed strange. I&#x27;d always let my emotions control me since as long as I&#x27;d known, but yesterday I just felt the feelings, but didn&#x27;t act upon them.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="august-10th">August 10th<a href="#august-10th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to August 10th" title="Direct link to August 10th">​</a></h3>
<p>I studied a little yesterday, mainly on imporving my vocabulary. But I still have some ways to go, before I can truely control my emotions. I feel as though that feeling was fleeting, and now I&#x27;m back to being controled by my emotions, I need to learn.</p>
<p>Anyways, words are funny.</p>
<p>&quot;It galls me to say this, but I never thought that you&#x27;d have the gall to punch someone in broad daylight, though it could be possible in an act of gall on your part.&quot; I dunno, but the first gall is like vex, the second is like the rude-boldness (impertinency), and the third is like bitterness.</p>
<p>&quot;To qualify for the award, you need to qualify your game time, and be qualified to even take it in the first place.&quot; Now I don&#x27;t know how I feel about this one, seems iffy, but whatever. First qualify is like to have a chance to get the award, but means to enter in a way. Second is like to lessen, to control. Third is to be recognized, in a way.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to qualify my tea, so I put some more tea bags to make it stronger, but this is qualified as strange to most; most people put one tea bag.&quot; This one I&#x27;m also not sure of, first qualify is to alter in severity/strength, second is attributing strange to the action of making the tea stronger.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to work. Slip slip roll roll step back-forward? Ate breakfast and am now deciding to workout more often, and with goals of being more athletic, and strong. I want to build big muscles, as I&#x27;m already seeing crazy imporvment on my shoulders just my exersicing once or twice. So what if I try other parts of my body? Like more core workouts, more like fast workouts, I dunno. But exersisicng is very fulfilling, if you think it is. Jab cross hook? I started exersisicng to become stronger as a human being, but I suppose there are other ways too. I will exersice now, be back in and hour or so (10:45 right now).</p>
<p>Now 12:12, I did not exersice, I talked to my grandparents, that is more important. I will now exersice, yes.</p>
<p>Currently 8:13, wow, that&#x27;s crazy. Yes I did exersice, and no I did not get a chance to try out some things. Why? Doesn&#x27;t matter, moving on, I spent a long time teaching my brother. Can you believe he thought 27/4 * 4/4 = 23, whatever. It annoys me, but he&#x27;s just baby, so what does it matter. I went walking with my parents, went I got back home it was starting to get dark.</p>
<p>I am studying now, since sine cosine and tan are cool, I am now learning about arcs.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="august-11th">August 11th<a href="#august-11th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to August 11th" title="Direct link to August 11th">​</a></h3>
<p>I slept, anyways, I woke up and the sun was shinning bright. Then I went back to sleep, and an hour later outside my window was crazy bright, like insanely bright. It went from a perfect day, to a too sunny day, then fast forward 3 hours and it rains heavily. I studied, did some things, studied, ate lunch, and am now studying.</p>
<p><em>Writing this on aug 12th, I studied, ate food, then studied, then played games, then exersiced, then exersiced some more, then taught my younger brother fractions (multiplication, substraction, addition, making them have the same denominator). It is quite easy to teach, you just need to be tough.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="august-12th">August 12th<a href="#august-12th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to August 12th" title="Direct link to August 12th">​</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday my dad challenged me to a pushup contest, we did this on an inclined surface. He got 100, but I only got 50 (my muscles were on fire). I relise that I was exersicing before that, but still, I coulden&#x27;t even do a hundred on the stairs?</p>
<p>Anyways, today I woke up, then woke my parents up, then went to sleep again. I slept till like 10:00, really felt good, but I lost valuable time.</p>
<p>I ate breakfast, then taught my brother for like 2 hours, he now knows angles. Every day I plan on teaching him something new, so by the time he is my age he&#x27;ll be able to do everything I can do and more (he&#x27;s kinda dumb though, but he is like 8 after all).</p>
<p>Currently 12:42, I am making my vocabulary better by learning new words.</p>
<p>Now 6:48, time kinda flew by. I ate lunch, played games, did some things, then some more. Honestly I cannot remember what I did, I think I just relaxed?? I dunno, but I will exersice now, no pushups (my muscle hurts/is sore).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="august-13th">August 13th<a href="#august-13th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to August 13th" title="Direct link to August 13th">​</a></h3>
<p>Yes I exersiced, then did some more things, the past week has been sort of productive, not as much as I&#x27;d like it to though. So today I&#x27;m studying hard, I&#x27;ve learned more about arcs and how to find the arc length of something using angles. I&#x27;ve also gotten better at solving those questions, anyways, back to work.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="august-14th">August 14th<a href="#august-14th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to August 14th" title="Direct link to August 14th">​</a></h3>
<p>I went back to work, did not do much work, I forgot what I did. Currently 8:47, it has been a long day. I spent most of the last 4/5 days teaching my brother. But today I focused on studying, and understood trig much better, I studied to my hearts content today, I am happy. I shall do that every day, yes.</p>
<p>Today an ice-cream truck came, it sold big waffle cones, I bought 2 (one for me, one for my little brother). After that I played soccer in my highschools soccer field, I learned that you should use the part behind the front of your toe to kick a ball.</p>

<p>I am writing this on the 17th, what happened? How did three days pass so fast, dunno. Anyways, what did I do on thia day? I&#x27;m not aure, me and my brother haven&#x27;t studied at all the last 2 days, we just played ARK SE. I dont remember what I did on the 15th, or the 16th. I just kinda relaxed and... well relaxed.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="august-16th">August 16th<a href="#august-16th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to August 16th" title="Direct link to August 16th">​</a></h3>
<p>Relaxed the day off, just played video games the WHOLE day. If you&#x27;re gonna do something, might as well do it with heart.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="august-17th">August 17th<a href="#august-17th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to August 17th" title="Direct link to August 17th">​</a></h3>
<p>Days are passing by, soon I will be starting highschool. I relaxed today so far, I mean the past two days I exersiced seriously, but just have not studied. I feel like I&#x27;m wasting my time, but who cares, it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ll do this forever (wasting time intentionally). It is fun, but boring, and ARK is very grindy. I&#x27;ve just started on building my house, I downloaded the game on the 16th, it is fun, really fun.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="august-18th">August 18th<a href="#august-18th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to August 18th" title="Direct link to August 18th">​</a></h3>
<p>I had spent the rest of the day yesterday playing ARK, I will now not do so, since it takes forever to get stuff. I will rather study-since it is a good use of time. Currently 8:25 I will study a little.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="august-19th">August 19th<a href="#august-19th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to August 19th" title="Direct link to August 19th">​</a></h3>
<p>I did study a little, but then spent the rest of the time with my dad talking/working on making a game in Godot. I am doing that right now, by following a tutorial first.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="august-20th">August 20th<a href="#august-20th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to August 20th" title="Direct link to August 20th">​</a></h3>
<p>I spent most of yesterday just following that tutorial, and doing dome stuff of my own. I decided to make a combat system in godot, but it is a work in progress.</p>
<p>What I want to do is simple, when the enemy is in range, I want to be able to attack them. How?</p>
<ul>
<li>If input e is given AND enemy is in range:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>signal p_attack</li>
<li>$Animated2D.play(&quot;attack&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Slime:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I recieve p_attack:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>s_health = s_health - 10</li>
<li>print(&quot;Player attacked slime for 10 damage! Slime: &quot;, s_health)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then vice versa for the slime and player. This is in no way 100% accurate to GD script, but I need to figure it out; I&#x27;ll go do that now.</p>
<p>Currently 4:30, what the heck have I been doing up until now? I don&#x27;t know, I just don&#x27;t know. I played Concord, the new one, it isn&#x27;t bad. Though I&#x27;m no good at fps games, so it aint for me, but the graphics aren&#x27;t bad. I kinda wish it took on a more army theme, that have been cooler, aliens are kinda lame (makes it feel kid-ish). The guns should&#x27;ve had better designs (shiny-er), but that&#x27;s a personal preference. I wish there were more shine, like everything having out-of-this world shine and lighting. The opening was dumb, but I liked it, how do I explain this. It was hard to follow along, but I got the gist of it.</p>
<p>Overall, I would not play it again, because I&#x27;m not the right person for the game. Helldivers I would play, why (it also has some fps)? Helldiveres is amazing, graphics and everything just seem so damn cool, but conccord isn&#x27;t bad either. I dunno, I don&#x27;t like being rushed in games, rocket league you can go at your own pace, so can you do that woth helldivers. Ah, but maybe if I give it a try I could end up liking it, who knows. I judge everything by weather it is cool enough or not, my hat is cool, my pencil is cool, rocket league is very cool. Being nice to people is cool, being strong is cool, being charsmatic is cool. So, why not do/have/yes these things? I also think music is cool, though wasting time is not cool, so is being weak/dumb.</p>
<p>See I think Concorrd, or whatever it&#x27;s name is, is not bad. It just isn&#x27;t exiting enough, perhaps if there were more things in the game-such as random ai killer bots circulating the maps, traps in the map, interactive parts of the map, a story mode, faster characters (speedy characters), explosions (LOTS), heavy (crazy) exiting music, open world mode, battle royales, cooler characters (why is the only army person in the game a woman? I could be wrong :| ). The fat person is overpowered, I kinda like the fat person though, he seems cool. And, no they aren&#x27;t actually overpowered, I&#x27;m exagerating, they simply seem like such to me, ME.</p>
<p>See when the fat guy apeared on my screen, I was confused, but when I looked closer, he kinda looked like me, but with a bmi of 50. I have a bmi of 25, mind you I am very muscled (I think so at least), and my legs have big muscles! All that aside, I should lose some weight, it is not visible, since it&#x27;s all going down to my stomach (I wear big t-shirts, makes my shoulders look big, and my stomach small). I consider myself not fat, or skinny, a tad overweight but nothing some exersice can&#x27;t fix.</p>
<p>Anyways, ark is fun, very fun, but I find it hard to be exiting. I think playing with friends would be more fun, could flex on them. Right now I&#x27;m gonna learn more about godot, by reading the offical godot intructions.</p>
<p>Was reading Godot Docs – master branch, they had a funny warning, &quot;here be dragons&quot;. Tell me if I&#x27;m wrong, but ain&#x27;t that from a old map with the unkown places labled &quot;here be dragons&quot;. Since they just didn&#x27;t know much, I think so anyways.</p>

<p>I woke up, I will now be productive. I will study the morning, then do some learning about godot in the afternoon. Side note: In about 8 days I&#x27;ll have my orieantation at the highschool I&#x27;m going to, it could be cool, but I already went to my soon-to-be highschool for summer school. So the orientation might not be anything special.</p>

<p>Yeah, I was not productive yesterday, but I learned many things. I am not intrested in playing games, I don&#x27;t have the commitment to games, I&#x27;d rather do something else. I spent most of yesterday with my family, and outdoors. I also got pizza with my younger brother, we ate it at a bench near my old school.</p>
<p>Currently 11:05, I will now be productive today!!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="august-23rd">August 23rd<a href="#august-23rd" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to August 23rd" title="Direct link to August 23rd">​</a></h3>
<p>I was not productive yesterday, I barely studied. I spent time playing games, relaxing, and spending time with my family. Now it was fun, but damn it&#x27;s already friday. I got one week or so till school starts, well more than one week. There is this game called heros of aethric, I like that game a lot. I stopped playing a while ago, used to be around level 300 (I think! I am not sure). I recently got into this game called ORNA, it is pretty cool, I am level 79 in it though (it was made by the same studio, which is why it is so good). I have not read up on godot in days, I am relaxing to the max. Why? I dunno I&#x27;m just taking a break.</p>
<p>I kept saying for the past days I&#x27;d study, I did not though. Today, is the day, I will follow up on that, since I hold my word as strong as iron! I&#x27;d say I was sort of productive the past few days, but not too much. Yesterday I tried this challenge, called the &quot;Riddick&quot;. Now this may or may not be a challenge, but anyways, you can search it up on google. I only complete level 1, maybe if I do it everyday I can get up to level 2.</p>
<p>Currently 3:00, I played games for around 2 hours. I am now studying, yes. Well I&#x27;ve been studying since like 2:30, but got distracted listening to music.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="august-24th">August 24th<a href="#august-24th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to August 24th" title="Direct link to August 24th">​</a></h3>
<p>Strange time skip, but it is now 9:47. I went to naigra falls today, my gosh was it amazing (I got to watch the mist maiden). I came back around 3:30, then just did some things, I don&#x27;t recall what though.</p>
<p>See before summer break I though I could use this time to study all day long, I truely could, but that&#x27;d be selfish. I have a family, I cannot just ignore them, and I couldn&#x27;t if I even wanted too. I could be asked to go play in the park, or something. Or perhaps I could simply get distracted playing games, it is hard to stay focused, but I will try. My parents have office, so I occasianally study, if I am not messing around with my younger brother (we can play/do random things for hours on end).</p>
<p>See, I like studying, but I also enjoy spending time with my family. Now, you cannot see into my life, but I do study maybe 3 times a week (for the past 2 weeks or so). Before that I think I studied more often, but I don&#x27;t properly document my day so I have no idea on which day I studied or not. I studied, but I did not write it down sometimes, or if I exersiced, but simply forgot to write it down (or just didn&#x27;t care to).</p>
<p>I should try not to get distracted, there is so much damn time in a day, yet I spend most of it doing random things (ha). Maybe this is a lesson, to not waste time. I don&#x27;t think my past couple weeks have been a waste of time, they have been fun, and rewarding (not in the sense of learning maths, but more so in fullfilment of the soul). What fills me is knowledge, hunger, thirst, and the desire to define my existance.</p>
<p>But first I have to define my own thoughs of my existance, I am growing? I suppose, but what of it? I need to figure out what I&#x27;m doing. I want to create life, using genetics to modify animals to make them something else. Like making a chicken gigantic! Or a lizard have two tails, something, or maybe giving a dog horns. I want to figure out the language of genetics, how it works, and if we can copy and paste some code. Like how does our body grow? It has intructions, but how do we give our own intructions, rather than simply altering the pre-existing boundries of code.</p>
<p>Anyways, random, but whatever.</p>

<p>I studied a bit today, and exersiced. I had to stop after 60 pushups because I was so damn tired I could throw up (weird I know, maybe I was just exausted). I saw this thing on the internet, where:</p>
<p>Pushup, touch your left shoulder
Pushup, touch your right shoulder
Pushup, touch your left knee
Pushup, touch your right knee
Pushup, touch your left foot
Pushup, touch your right foot
Pushup, slide your arm down to touch your left foot
Pushup, slide your arm down to touch your right foot
Pushup, do a hindu pushup (or &quot;mike tyson&quot; pushup)
Pushup, then do a sqaut.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s ten pushups right there, they somehow feel easier than doing normal pushups. Well I didn&#x27;t exactly do it in a row, I took like 10-30 seconds between reps (of ten), depending on how I was feeling (my muscles). After doing about 6 reps I felt fine, but later in the day my muscles were sooooreee. I should just link the video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lycV3pd4&amp;t=119s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_lycV3pd4&amp;t=119s</a></p>
<p>I wanna be that strong one day, I will! Anyways, I should get back to it.</p>
<p><em>I am writing this on aug 26th, I went to the park near my house, I did monkey bars. Monkey bars felt super easy, but I suppose they should be, anyways. I was going really fast on the monkey bars till I saw this big brown spider on the bar next, I stopped and dropped down. I noticed a sharp pain in my hand, it was bleeding, both of my hands were. On my palms were half inch portions without skin and just flesh. Now it didn&#x27;t really look that bad, but it was kinda annoying, I mean what if it gets infected? I went home after that, since I really did not want the wound to get infected. I think the friction from swiming from bar to bar shaved off my skin. Anyways, I went home and put some aftershave on the wound, my god it was the worst pain I&#x27;d ever felt in my life. But it was kinda cool, I unlocked a new level of pain, it wasn&#x27;t that bad. See it went away in like 30 minutes (the worst part of the pain), so it really doesn&#x27;t matter. If you just tough it out you&#x27;ll be fine, a small (kinda yeah) wound like that is nothing! I&#x27;m no baby, plus if I&#x27;m to become a man one day, I must start upon it (the road to yknow) now. I feel like I&#x27;m talking to myself, maybe it&#x27;s better that way, cause I could learn a thing or two from myself.</em></p>

<p>I&#x27;m kinda exited for highschool, it&#x27;ll be a lot of fun, I mean meeting new people is always a blast. Why? I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve mentioned before how you learn from every person you meet, and that meeting more people only expands your view of the world. I look back, I suppose even now, in the future I&#x27;m looking back at the me of now. I&#x27;m happy, why? Because I&#x27;m improving, slight may it be, it is daily though, so it&#x27;s fine. My dad tells me to never let a day go by wihout doing 1% of your goal, at minimum. Perfection, dang it, seems fleeting as a concept. But surely it&#x27;s possible, not impossible? Though I&#x27;m probably wrong, I need to get my head in the game of life. Nostalgia is great, you feel nostalgic. Don&#x27;t miss those times, look back and see how great they were, in all their glory. My friends from middle school, the times I had, everything-was amazing/incredible. I grew taller and stronger, but most importantly I became wiser (meeting people and failing). I do not miss those times, I simply remember how great they were, as to honor a memory is not to dwell on it, but to bask in the thought of &quot;I did that, ha&quot;. See I feel like sometimes life goes fast, I&#x27;m almost in highscool, it&#x27;s crazy. But then again time has gone by as it should, I have no qwalms with how I spent it. Since every time I did something wrong, I could look back to not do it again (idk learn from your mistakes). All the time I wasted has been reminders of how I don&#x27;t enjoy it, so I won&#x27;t (if I deem it as such) do it. See I&#x27;ve learned more about wasting time, some things could appear as a waste of time, but in reality are crucial is not important to realise sooner than later. They come before studying, I&#x27;m sure you must know what that it.</p>
<p>Besides the point, but anyways, I will study. I&#x27;ve though smoking looks very cool for the longest time, but most people look really bad (stupid) smoking. Maybe I&#x27;m just making it up in my head, after watching movies with cool protagonists smoking. But I&#x27;ve learned they aren&#x27;t cool, they hurt you.</p>
<p>I have mastered simplifying square roots! Ahhh that took forever, currently 12:18, the last two days have been spent on learning hwo to figure out simplifying square roots. I have done it! I cannot believe I haven&#x27;t learned that yet, it seems like an important skill that isn&#x27;t very hard. I guess I just forgot to learn it, but I did it now. This song is amazing: &quot;Goldfinger - Superman&quot;, currently listening.</p>

<p>Went to see a phisiotherapist, should&#x27;ve done so a year ago, but anyways. She told me some things, and some more things, thoracic this and that. I have some knots, or muscles imbalenses, or something. I&#x27;m not quite sure, but maybe the sleepiness is getting to me.</p>

<p>Today was orientation for highschool, is was cool. We walked in (I walked there with my friend stepahn and simon), and were greeted by cheering from our seniors, it was cool. We got name tags, and a tour of the school, and got chromebooks. It was cool, ice breakers, talks, etc.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a class="theme-edit-this-page"
