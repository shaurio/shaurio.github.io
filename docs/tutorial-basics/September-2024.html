<p>It is now september, I enjoyed august, I studied, I exersiced, and I had fun during summer break. I will be starting highschool soon. Summer ended, I am starting highschool, it is crazy, time didn&#x27;t fly, it was amazing. I had so many gaols and plans for summer, but ended up just arbitrarily studying math here and there, it was fun, really fun. I had a great time, and it was good. I&#x27;m in highschool huh, wow. When I was in 6th I wondered what I would look like entering highschool, I look exactly as I had imagined. Am I a great man yet? No, but I can be a great person.9</p>

<p>Just relaxed, but studied today, in fact I&#x27;m happy with how much I studied. It let me refresh on some concepts I&#x27;d near forgotten. I went to my to-be highschool to figure out how to lock my kickscooter in case I take it to school. Normally I would walk, but it&#x27;s faster to go on kickscooter (now that I have one). I live 25-30 minutes walking from the highschool, but time flies while walking to and fro.</p>

<p>I woke up, and am now studying, why? Cause before I need to know some history on the world, before I get into those classes.</p>
<p>Currently 10:31, night time. I got Stardew valley and played it, I also studied a bit, not really enough though. I spent like 4 hours playing it today, got to day 20. I have 5000 coins, got them in one go from cashing in like 200 parsnip (less than that).</p>
<p>Anyways, as I was taking our the trash with my dad, I saw a skunk rumiging through the trash bags. We left, deciding to come back another day (the trash cans were full to the brim).</p>
<p>My dad asked me if this was my diary, it might really be a diary. A diary is where you take note of dates and times, and the experiances that follow.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="september-3rd">September 3rd<a href="#september-3rd" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to September 3rd" title="Direct link to September 3rd">​</a></h3>
<p>Did some math in the morning, though got distracted and only studied for 15 minutes. Then I ate breakfest, did some things (stardew valley). Currently 11:53, I have been studying a good bit, I don&#x27;t remember how long I&#x27;ve been studying, neither do I care anymore. If I&#x27;m serious about it, I don&#x27;t need numbers to quantify how much I studied, I need to see if I learned anything at all. Most of what I&#x27;ve been doing for the past days are just algebra and graph questions, since I need the practice (you cannot practice those enough, there is always some trick or formula).</p>
<p>I deeply want to do the things I mentioned in august (biological advancment), weather that be in medicine, or... what is there other than medicine? Bio-tech, isn&#x27;t that just medicine (what I mean to say is.. never mind they are different)? How do I reach that point, of developing things. But what exactly do I want to develop? I had so many ideas, but I have to narrow it down to one, and set my mind.</p>
<p>Just searched it up, a thing called SyntheMol exists, incredible. It&#x27;s mind blowing (the description of it at least).</p>
<p>When I was in 7th grade, all I knew was that you go to school, learn, and come back. Though after taking the math olympiads, I relised there is a whole world of stuff I didn&#x27;t know. Just going to school and coming back is not enough, I learned that when I took it in a nice facility. Those classmates I had, the ones in the same math club as I, were smarter than me (no doubt). But they knew something I should have known long ago, the internet can you teach you things (math). I used to think I was smart, till I joined that club, then it occured to me &quot;how are they so smart?&quot; After all they&#x27;ve been going to the same school as I, but they had knowledge grades above my own understanding (at the time). I came to know later, most of them had elder siblings, this didn&#x27;t bother me. Looking back it does make sense, after all I tell my brother to do khan acedemy (he finished 4th grade on khan, so now he is at 35% on 5th). He is... wait what grade is he in, I&#x27;ll be back.</p>
<p>Currently 4:20, he is gonna go to 3rd grade soon (he is kinda small, in my opinion at least). I made ramen for my brother, then some for myself. I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing, so my mom came in sometimes and told me some things. Such as: &quot;it is done&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t boil it too much&quot;. After we ate, we played stardew, I bought some chickens (and built a coop). I have no idea how to feed them, they are &quot;thin&quot; and &quot;grumpy&quot;.</p>

<p>First day of highschool, it went amazing. I met up with some friends and walked there. I toom my kickscooter along, to keep my bag on (and for conveniance sake). First class was science, seemed like a cool teacher, and a cool class. Second class was geography, I think it is also an intresting class. Third class was gym, we played dodgeball the whole class (amazing). And fourth class was buisnesss, seems like a strict teacher, but an awsome (like fun and cool) teacher.</p>
<p>I am very happy with my classes, though I wish I had some form of math. We chose like 8 classes, we do 4 in the first semester, and 4 in the second semester. I don&#x27;t really like it, kinda minimizes the work load (but maybe it is better in ways I haven&#x27;t figured out).</p>
<p>Currently 6:00, I have been relaxing, and also studying. I am just doing problems of math, since it is good practice, and is much more efficiant than what I was doing previously. Just doign every (not quite) math question under the sun, till I know them all, is pretty good (though I won&#x27;t 100% understand why I got every answer).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="september-5th">September 5th<a href="#september-5th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to September 5th" title="Direct link to September 5th">​</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at 6:30, I took my brother out to play soccer (so I&#x27;d practice a bit). There were some little kids, and I was reminded how being a bystander to things is not any better than the culprit themselves. Some parents just don&#x27;t teach their kids manners, and honestly make me mad.</p>
<p>Anyways, currently 9:31, I went a tried out for soccer at my highschool. It was fun, not much running, but I was still tired at the end. I do not believe I did good, I kinda embarresed myself (in my own mind), and just kinda made dumb mistakes. I could&#x27;ve done better, but it is what it is, I learned somw valuable things though (pretaining to soccer). Some exersices, and some drills that could be useful to practice. I do not believe I will make it past cutoffs, even though you have a 50% chance to be accepted into the team (20 players, and 40 people tried out). It was mostly 10th graders, barely any 9th&#x27;s.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m gonna relax, then sleep, why not? What was I doing all day? School, tryouts (2 hours), walking back home (20-30 minutes), and laying around (most of the day).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="september-6th">September 6th<a href="#september-6th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to September 6th" title="Direct link to September 6th">​</a></h3>
<p>Today was fun, we built water towers in science class (made of paper). I made a big cylinder in the center, then 4 support cylinders, with less width, taped around 4 directions (east, west, north, south). After that I taped a news paper to the top t serve as a flat surface that can hold something. After all this was said and done, we tested it by putting a small container of marbles (200 grams), it worked, and I think it could possibly hold up 4 pounds or more.</p>
<p>I am tired, I haven&#x27;t studied in 2 days, I am tired, I&#x27;m gonna relax. Currently 6:30.</p>
<p>I ended up wasting time, starting to think I need to keep myself busy, and have self-restraint when it comes to stupid stuff (playing games or just plain wasting time).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="september-7th">September 7th<a href="#september-7th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to September 7th" title="Direct link to September 7th">​</a></h3>
<p>I slept yesterday, instead of eating dinner, I dunno I was just too tired to do anything (I did eat something around 7 though). Currently 1:25, I have been playing astro bot from 8 to 9, and watched tv from 7:30 to 8. After that I made my own breakfest (garlic bread with pesto, tomatoes, lettuce, and ranch). We did puja, as today is ganesh puja. I met my great grandma today, it was cool, I mean it is also pretty crazy. Since I was born 3 generations after hers (great grandma/grandpa, grandma/grandpa, dad/mom, me). I have been studying a little, there are still concepts I don&#x27;t understand, like finding the vortex in a quadratic, but there are always formulas (I just cannot seem to make them stick in my head, these formulas).</p>

<p>Writing this on the 9th</p>
<p>It was sunday, I did some things in the morning, don&#x27;t really remember what though. I then did some more things, I think I studied, then watched a movie after eating lunch. I had planned to meet up with my friends to play soccer, like usual, but I was so caught up in the movie I ended up being 30 minutes late. Anyways, I played from 3:30, to around 8:00 (like 8:06 idk). I got home and ate, slept, slept.</p>

<p>I went to school, it was fun, we played soccer at school most of lunch break. My leg muscles a sore, but maybe it is a good thing, exersice and what not. I did some stuff today, and it is already 8:00, crazy how time flies (though I think my use of it was not bad). I wasted time, but I also relised some things, I also studied a little, some english, some math. I really like biology, but I&#x27;m having a hard time fitting it into my schedule, since things happen. I should think more about this though. Ah, yes an idea, if I finish studying math, I can do biology (instead of just diong english or wasting time).</p>

<p>Today was tryouts #2, they had cutoffs. I was cutoff, I made dumb mistakes, and the drills were just skill based. I guess dribbling skills tie into the game, but I lack severely in that aspect. I can run with the ball, like dribble it along side me, but not do those like.. skill based dribbling. I believe it is where it went wrong, but I made mistakes in other places though.</p>
<p>I mean if they see something good, they think the player is good, which usually falls true. I think myself to be good at soccer, like not crazy good, though In a like posistional setting I suppose I&#x27;m lost. I think it was just the way it panned out, and I was not too happy about it, but I know I&#x27;m not a bad player. Hmm, there were 40 people, and 22 make it. I got cut on the first cutoff, dang, but I was kinda embarresing (dribbling was.. not good). They set up cones like (almost exactly) a foot away from each other, and we had to dribble through them in spesific ways, this I never though about, or practiced. I guess I know what to improve upon, but still dang it.</p>
<p>Just now the ice cream truck passed by where I live, it has parked right in front of my window, it is so so loud! Oh my gosh its crazy loud, it stopped now. I was thinking of getting ice cream but it&#x27;s 7:25, I&#x27;m gonna eat dinner soon-so there is no point.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to it, yes it sucks, but I don&#x27;t really care. Being able to do good dribbling is cool and all, but it is important, but I guess it shows your sincerity to the sport if you know how to do it, but damn it. I guess I just wasn&#x27;t &quot;good&quot; enough, but I love soccer, and play it well. They didn&#x27;t do if you can run fast, or if you can play well, just skill based things that I guess shows somewhat the level of &quot;soccer&quot; someone has. I dunno, but I guess I just need to better, I need to focus on getting accurate dribbling.</p>

<p>Today we did stuff in school, it was cool. I learned a lot in business class, like how franchises sell their name, and corporations are run by stakeholders.</p>
<p>Dang I feel really busy, like I have zero time. I can&#x27;t play games, like at all, not that I reall need to to, but that gives accros my point. I need to do so many things, but really it is doable, but I just need to do them.</p>

<p>Played football, did some things.</p>
<p>I had table top gaming club, where you play DND, I though it would be hard. It was pretty simple to grasp, just use your imagination, and dice. I did it for 2 hours, it went by in 2 seconds, it was that much fun. I had an amazing time, and the first time, playing dnd.</p>
<p>HAd physio, got some exersice recomendations.</p>

<p>Woke up, did some shopping, ate lunch, went to play soccer with friends at 2:45, came back around 8. Saturday, it was fun. Played with people who where nearby, and some more, it was fun.</p>

<p>Yesterday I hung out with my friends, we studied and had fun together at the park and Tim hortens. Starbucks coffee tastes better, but is more expensive, go to america and find a nice Starbucks; you will be happy with what you drink (I was).</p>
<p>Today I had school, it was fun, I also hung out at my friends house, and studied a bit. Just refreshed on how factoring and just in general how variables work. I didn&#x27;t really learn anything, but more than anything it was more like a hang out.</p>
<p>I am just gonna finish up some work I have from school.</p>

<p>I went to school, did some stuff, came back. Canada weather is crazy, freezing in the morning (6:00-7:30), and crazy hot later (10:50-12:00). I don&#x27;t know for sure the times, but heat probably stays till around 3 or 4.</p>

<p>I went to school, and learned soem stuff from science and other classes. I played soccer, I am improving, but I cannot shoot well. My friends told me the way to shoot is to kick with the top of your foot, not edge (toe). I used to kick solely with the side of my foot, but that kinda hurts. Anyways, I did some homework, and some physio exersices. My muslces are very visible, forearms, shoulders, and traps, and.. shoulders. My shoulders are now muscled! I just need to be more consistant, and my phsiotherepist told em not to do pushups, so I stopped about 2 or 3 weeks ago. I am focusing on other muscles, so yeah.</p>
<p>I will keep doing some homework.</p>

<p>Today is thursday, there is a soccer game today, but also my table top gaming club. I decided to do both, but in reality only did one, the club. I whished my friends who were on the team all the best, and went home after the game was over (the club ends at the same time).</p>

<p>Friday, went great. I felt very emotional at night though, like something was really messing with my head. I decided to just figure it out, see cause and effect.</p>

<p>On thursday my class took a personality test, I got &quot;protagonist&quot;. It was the 16 personality test, pretty damn accurate. There is a lot I&#x27;m not writing but I need not. I am having so much fun in highschool, so far it&#x27;s been a blast, just playing soccer, learning, and hanging out with friends. We did frisbee for 3 days, wedensday, thurday, and friday. Before we were doing softball, but my friend sungu broke his leg, it&#x27;s pretty sad (they stopped the softball unit). I will get back to workign on my buisiness project.</p>

<p>We did things at school, it was so fun, truly so much fun. Highschool is incredible, so many new people, so many new firends, its amazing. You meet like 10 new people everyday, yes.</p>

<p>Had a business test, was pretty cool.</p>
<p>Today I told my friend Anthony M. How to solve pollution, I wish him the best in life, and hope he succedes. I could honestly pursue that too, but my intrest falls in biology, though climate is important.</p>

<p>What did I do today? Play soccer, when I has online classes.</p>
<p>So today was supposed to be a online learning day, I thought it was just a day off, so I spent most of the day playing soccer. I knew I has some sort of meeting at 2:00 online, but forgot about it. In the end, I was marked absent by 3/4 of my classes. I was just careless, and shouldve understood this whole wierd day.</p>
<p>For some reason, we have no school, but we do have school. This is the first time I&#x27;ve experianced something like this, I thought it was a day off, but it was not. I did all the assingments posted, and all the work, but didn&#x27;t/wasnt there for attendance.</p>
<p>Whatever, it&#x27;s my fault, it will not happen again, since I will fully understand what things are next time.</p>

<p>Our soccer unit started, it was very fun, I apologised to my teacher for not attending the meeting (I only had one meeting). He said it was just to take attendance, and that nothing really happened.</p>
<p>I like business class, it is fun, but at the same time we learn a lot. He teaches very well, so do most of my teachers.</p>

<p>Played soccer during phys ed, it was fun, my shoulders are more well definded, it&#x27;s surpirising how much muscle my shoulder has (I just started doing shoulder exersices, with a 2lbs weight that too). This shows hard work pays off, anyways, my parents took me to starbucks. I had a venti mocha frappe, either I got bigger, or the drink got smaller. I finished it pretty quick, but it tasted great. I mean it&#x27;s suger, beans, milk, chocolate, and water. It isnt the best for your health, so next time I have this will be maybe a couple months from now.</p>

<p>I just learned this technique that lets you solve any quadratic equation.</p>
<p>x^2 + bx + c</p>
<p>(b/2+u)(b/2-u) = c</p>
<p>Lets take an example:</p>
<p>x^2 + 6x + 14</p>
<p>(3+u)(3-u) = 14</p>
<p>So:</p>
<p>9 - u^2 = 14
-u^2 = 5
u^2 = -5
u = √-5</p>
<p>Meaning:</p>
<p>(3+√-5)(3-√-5) = 14</p>
<p>Is this true? Yes.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I played soccer with my friends from 3 to 7, it was a lot of fun. I mean, so much fun, I will miss them.</p>
<p>Today I studied, but I noticed something different, I was understanding the problems as I was doing them, I was starting to see the way to solve it. I was even able to do some problems in my head, it was a great feeling, practice is incredible.</p>

<p>Last of of september, yes. Monday, what did I do? I did many things, but I relised that it was the last day of september. Can I say I spent september well? Yes, though I could&#x27;ve done better. Regret hurts, very much, but it&#x27;s what you do about the pain that makes you strong.</p>
