<p>Alright, it&#x27;s April. March was a productive month, even though I didn&#x27;t write much down. This April I will try to be better, as my birthday is on the 12th.  I&#x27;m still in Canada, and I&#x27;m still 13, but this month I will turn fourteen.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-1st">April 1st<a href="#april-1st" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 1st" title="Direct link to April 1st">​</a></h3>
<p>I woke up, currently 7:55, I will eat breakfeast. Currently 10:11, I&#x27;m frustrated. I will go to the park with my family.</p>
<p>Currently 12:20, I&#x27;m back and will eat lunch.</p>
<p>Ate lunch, was delicious, I am happy. Currently 3:36, I relaxed and just layed on the floor. I then bought a $35, Medieval Dysnasty. The graphics were so life-like I felt like I was the one chopping trees, honestly a good game. I just need to figure out how to do things, it is like minecraft but realistic and unlike any other game. But I liked the graphics and gameplay, anyways, I will do something.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stockpile resources</li>
<li>Don&#x27;t buy from shop, sell to shop</li>
<li>Farm yourself</li>
<li>Have money to pay taxes</li>
<li>Sell tools for profit to pay taxes</li>
<li>Don&#x27;t die</li>
</ul>
<p>These are things you should do in game. Also build a house near a village, easy money and quest access. Currently 4:40, I was just wasting time, I also took out the trash which didn&#x27;t take long. I will study for some time, then exersice.</p>
<ul>
<li>2<em>2</em>2 = 8</li>
<li>2*2^2 = 8</li>
<li>2^3 = 8</li>
<li>4^2</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>2(2)<sup>2</sup> * 3(2)<sup>2</sup> = 6 * 2^4 . . . 6*16 . . . 96 ✔️</li>
</ul>
<p>So</p>
<p>ax<sup>m</sup> * bx<sup>n</sup> =  ab * x<sup>m+n</sup></p>
<p>checks out. This is for multiplying equations with the same base, it seems to work fine.</p>
<ul>
<li>2(2)<sup>2</sup> / 4(2)<sup>2</sup> = 2/4 * 2<sup>2-2</sup> . . . 1/2 * 2<sup>0</sup> . . . 1/2 * 1 . . . 0.5 ✔️</li>
<li>8/16 = 0.5 so yes this is factual.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so</p>
<p>ax<sup>m</sup> / bx<sup>n</sup> =  a/b * x<sup>m-n</sup></p>
<p>This is very helpful if you get a formula based problem, or something that would simplify into this type of equation, time saver. So then what about regular equations:</p>
<ul>
<li>5^2 * 3^2 = 25 * 9 . . . 225</li>
<li>5^2 * 3^2 = 15^2 . . . 225</li>
</ul>
<p>So (5 * 3)^2, I&#x27;m sure you know why. (a*b)^n . Well anyways, currently 5:30, I am just learning. A whole hour passed, I really havent been productive have I, I should pick up the pace.</p>
<ul>
<li>6^2 / 3^2 = (6/3)^2 . . . 2^2 . . . 4</li>
<li>36/9 = 4 this checks out</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently 6:45, I played games for a while. It was the same game I was playing earlier today, I like it, it is too realistic. I also helped my dad with making a video for his website, he on the side made a website. The website is cool, it is about creating online cards for people (but in a much much more fun way). I edited the video and yeah, I got paid $0, but in return he got me the $35 game. I think it was worth it, anyways, he says I should be more entrepenruel. I should try teaching little kids Scratch? I mean I could, it woulden&#x27;t be very hard If I had a plan (I do), but aren&#x27;t there thousands of people teaching scratch? I&#x27;m not even in highschool, but I dunno. I will work on school work, currently 6:55.</p>
<p>Currently 8:00, I wrote some more in my story, then went on a walk. I went with my dad and younger brother, it was good, I&#x27;m now just writing some more. Currently 9:00, I wrote a good amount, I&#x27;m happy with where the stories going. I will read it again, to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any simple mistakes.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-2nd">April 2nd<a href="#april-2nd" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 2nd" title="Direct link to April 2nd">​</a></h3>
<p>So today I woke up, and then it was super windy. It was 45mph winds, I was getting pushed back.Now I&#x27;ll work on the story. Wrote a little, wasted time, and will now do 100 pushups. Currently 5:22, now 5:55. I spent like a couple minutes looking at myself in the mirror, but yeah, I did the 100 pushups. I went down to fill my bottle in between, doing 10 regular (easy) pushups is now simple. I wan&#x27;t to do other kinds of pushups that target different muscles, I enjoy looking at my arm and seeing muscle. I will now work on writiing the story. And eat food too, yeah.</p>
<p>Currently 6:40, ate some food, will eat more. I finished the rough draft of my asignemtn. I will polish it now, I will work more on it seperatly. Currently like 7:00, (6:58), I will do 50 pushups. I checked, I do not have any homework.</p>
<p>Currently 7:35, I did 80 pushups, wasted time, then punched my weights. Because I wasted time, I punched my weight 50 times, not very had though. I will not play games today, I will study.</p>
<ul>
<li>4<sup>2</sup> * (2<sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = (8<sup>3</sup>)2</li>
<li>16 * 8<sup>2</sup> . . . 16 * 64</li>
<li>16 * 64 = 1024</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, checks out.</p>
<ul>
<li>4 * ((x)^3)*3 + ((2^2) * 0)</li>
<li>4 * 3(x)^3 + 0</li>
<li>4 * 3x^3</li>
<li>12x^3</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on.</p>
<ul>
<li>(4 * 3)^3</li>
<li>(64 * 27)</li>
<li>(12)^3</li>
<li>((6*2)^3)</li>
<li>((((2 + 1)^4)/9) + (3^0 + 2^0 + 1^0))^3((4/3)^0)</li>
<li>(((1 + 1) - ((2^5)/32)) * 12)^3</li>
<li>(((((11*11)/(11^0)+2)/123) + 11)^(33/11))</li>
<li>((((((12)^3) + ((4*3)^3))/1728)*6)^(3((((2 + 1)^4)/9) + (3^0 + 2^0 + 1^0))^3((4/3)^0))/1728)+0</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how they all equal 1728. You can represent things in many ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>(((1728 * 2)/1728) * 6)^3(1728/1728)+0</li>
<li>(2 * 6)^3(1)+0</li>
<li>(12)^3</li>
<li>12^3</li>
<li>1728</li>
</ul>
<p>Get it? Well anyways, the last example is bit tricky, but if you simplify it is isnt very hard.</p>
<ul>
<li>(12*x)^3 = 12x^3</li>
<li>(12*4)^3</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently 9:55, ate dinner, and did 20 pushups. I&#x27;ve done 200 today, nice.</p>
<p><em>Next day, slept.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-3rd">April 3rd<a href="#april-3rd" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 3rd" title="Direct link to April 3rd">​</a></h3>
<p>Wasted time, dissapointed in myself. I know wasting time is bad, but I wasted time. Currently 5:47, I wasted time, then I exersiced. I did 50 pushups and some random weight things. I will now work on the story, then studey at 6:30. No game today, study yes, yeah. Currently 6:15, worked a little on it. I am wondering no more, to folly is to regret. The regret is folly if preventable, such folly is only regretible beyond the folly of thy&#x27;self. Do thou understand, regret, pain, folly, all burn. To be regretful, or not to be. Such is the folly we all make, choosing the former only leads to pain. Physically and metnally our regret manifests as our enternal follies. But to no avail doth this sensation avail, to be, to be better. Finally, have thou centraly understood that while folly, may be regret, to regret is folly if prefentable. Only doth who do not persue these regretful things will not folly, this is the only way. To do, or not to do? There art&#x27;only not, as to do means regret with entails the folly of pain on oneself which could&#x27;ve been prevnted. But as I preach, I myself am victum to my own folly. As regret sets in, the folly becomes somewhat of a common occurance. I, myself hath known many things about folly, but to implement them in such precousious ways elude me.</p>
<p>Anyways, I will study.</p>
<ul>
<li>(3^(3*2)) = 729</li>
<li>(3^3*2) = 54</li>
<li>(3^3)^2 = 729</li>
<li>3^6 = 729</li>
<li>3^3^2 = 19683</li>
</ul>
<p>Random thing I thought up, it&#x27;s uncanny the exorbant amount of ways you can compose an equation. I will keep studying. Holy wow negative exponents are insane, whoever thought up negative exponents is either a genuis, or someone who wants others to suffer.</p>
<p>Turn weakness into strength, as no one else will do it for you.</p>
<p>I was nervous while auditioning today, but that nervousess made my voice very deep, and rich. I turned nervousness into my strength. I never thought I would be nervous, but to be honest I was a little. I was auditioning today, to be MC (Master of Cerimonies) For the school concert in a month. I think it went pretty well.</p>
<p>Just now, I felt super tired. I&#x27;m drinking some really sour drink, like it is just really sour. It probably isn&#x27;t good for me, I was smoking on a lolipop, I put it down on a tray when I was done. I felt so old, but reality hit, I&#x27;m still a kid. Nice, I will continue studying, and tr to find out this whole negative exponents thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>2^-4 . . . 1/2^4 . . . 1/16</li>
<li>1/243 . . . 1/3^5 . . . 3^-5</li>
<li>3x^-3 . . . 3 * 1/x^3 . . . 3/x^3</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on:</p>
<ul>
<li>(3^3)/(3^5) = 3^3-5 . . . 3^-2 . . . 1/3^2 . . . 1/9</li>
<li>27/243 = 9/81 . . . 3/27 . . . 1/9</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently 7:06, talked to my mom for a bit. Then did some thinking, I looked up to my ceiling and saw a flower. Then another, after that I saw a whole field of flowers. I thought about bad things, and then two horns and a circle showed up. I agreed in my head, the demonic picture turned into a heart. I felt great, a face showed up, it smiled and wore glasses. It took off the glasses and seemed mor happy the more I agreed with it. I&#x27;ve had a understanding, I need to be better, to do better. I will continue studying.</p>
<p>Just watched a video: &quot;Medieval Dynasty How To Get Seeds , Fertiliser And Wheat Grain Farming Chapter V A Farm Guide 2022&quot;</p>
<p>Super informative, anyways, I will get back to work. Just watched some &quot;how to&#x27;s&quot; about that game. Don&#x27;t really regret it as it is important info, if I waste time on a game, I should at least know how to play.</p>

<p>For change to be made, change needs to be present. &quot;I&#x27;m getting better&quot;, Not, &quot;I&#x27;m the best&quot;.</p>
<p>Do you wan&#x27;t to be better, then change, be present in the procces of changing. Learn from mistakes, explore, get better.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2^-4)/(2^-3) = 1/2^4 / 1/2^3 . . . (1/16) / (1/8) . . . 1/2</li>
<li>(1/16) * 16 . . . 16/16 . . . 1</li>
<li>(1/8) * 16 . . . 16/8 . . . 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Get it? Because the negative exponents was simplified, then I simplified it even further. This is amazing, is it very simple. Exponents are just another exponantial increase of a value. The value with a exponent with one less will be &quot;value&quot; times less than it.</p>
<ul>
<li>2^-4 = 1/16</li>
<li>2^-3 = 1/8</li>
</ul>
<p>It is greater than the less than in terms of less value.</p>
<ul>
<li>2^4 = 16</li>
<li>2^3 = 8</li>
</ul>
<p>And</p>
<ul>
<li>(2^4)/(2^3) = 2^4 / 2^3 . . . 16 / 8 . . . 2/1</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you see how it inverts? How the negative makes it the opposite? This is very cool, I see how the same pricipales apply, just inverted.</p>
<p>Anyways, currently 7:43, before writing all this, I played games till 6:30. I then talked with my dad till like 7 something. I planted seeds in that game, it was so easy. Buy seeds from vilager, then buy fertalizer. Afterwards hoe the area, then fertalize, then plant seeds after hoeing one more time. How to buy seeds? Make stone knives, sell stone knives, by switching tabs. Then using the money from selling, buy the things. Simple, so yeah I will continue studying.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>(2^-4)/(2^-3) = 1/2^4 / 1/2^3 . . . (1/16) / (1/8) . . . (1/16) * (8/1) . . . 8/16 . . . 1/2</li>
<li>1/2 * 2/1 = (1<em>2)/2 * 1/(2</em>1) . . . 2/2 * 1/2</li>
<li>2/2 * 1/2 = (2<em>1)/2 * (2</em>1)/2 . . . 2/2 * 2/2 . . . 1 * 1</li>
<li>1 * 1 = 1</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x27;m sure you already understood that though. 2 * 1/2 = 2/1 * 2/2 . . . 2/2 . . . 1</p>
<ul>
<li>You can also flip the divsion to make it multiplication. Flip the one that is being the divider.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways.</p>
<ul>
<li>3^0 = 1</li>
</ul>
<p>Why? Because 3*0 = 0. But we are talking about exponents, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>3^1 = 3</li>
<li>3^2 = 3*3 . . . 9</li>
<li>3^3 = 3<em>3</em>3 . . . 27</li>
<li>3^4 = 3<em>3</em>3*3 . . . 81</li>
<li>3^5 = 3<em>3</em>3<em>3</em>3 . . . 243</li>
<li>And so on...</li>
</ul>
<p>What do these have in common? They all increase exponentially by the exponent it was given. So what about zero?</p>
<ul>
<li>It would not be 3, or 0. Beacause it is not mutiplication based, that is the aftermath</li>
<li>3 * nothing? No</li>
<li>Nothing? No</li>
<li>It would be divided into as many parts as it can that isn&#x27;t zero.</li>
<li>1+1+1 = 3*1 = 3^1?</li>
<li>Nah, can&#x27;t be that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x27;m also stumpted, but I&#x27;ll think on it. Based on what we known, zero is nothing. But zero cannot be zero in the case of there being value applied to it. But we all know 3*0 is 0, so what about exponents? I just searched it up, it&#x27;s genuis.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 * 3 = 3</li>
<li>3 = 3</li>
</ul>
<p>One as a mutiplication value, is non-existant. Such as zero is believed to be, so in the case of 1 being the exponent. The other mutiplicative is shown, but since nothing is being shown, nothing is being mutiplied, meaning 1 stands alone.</p>
<ul>
<li>3*1 = 3</li>
<li>but what if there was no 3?</li>
<li>1 = 1</li>
</ul>
<p>So that is why, because with the abcense of value, zero is there to multiply. Now, I don&#x27;t know everything but I do know that this makes sense. Something ^0 is just that exponetiaed by nothing. So soley one remains, the value is gone, only one remains. Just think of it as &quot;nothing&quot; is mutiplication being present. One is the zero of mutiplication, zero is nothing, and as nothing cannot be something, even if fed something. 3*0 = 0.</p>
<p>Whoever thought this up is very smart, I cannot believe anyone had the brains to figure out that the property of 1 in mutiplication is almost zero in terms of things. Anyways, I will eat dinner. Currently 8:06.</p>
<p><em>Next day, slept.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-5th">April 5th<a href="#april-5th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 5th" title="Direct link to April 5th">​</a></h3>
<p>When I get back from school, there are things I need to do.</p>
<p>6:50</p>
<p>Now 8:15. I went to school, they released the info about who the MC (master of cermimonies) was gonna be. Guess what? It&#x27;s me!!! There were like 12-15 people, only 2 were chosen. Some 7th grade girl, and me were chosen. She is high energy, and I&#x27;m serious and proffesinal. I was chosen because they liked my deep (rich) voice, and how professinal I was. They also said I should smile a little. The girl was chosen because they most liekly wanted to have one girl one boy. If that wasn&#x27;t the case, shaan would&#x27;ve been picked. I wanted to be MC with shaan, but as situation has it, it wasn&#x27;t meant to be. But the girl is very high-energy, so we will contrast each other.</p>
<p>Anyways, I am shocked that I got picked. I will be the MC for a concert of thousands of people. There are 1000-ish students in our school, their parents will be coming. Guests will be coming, friends and family will be coming, and also teachers. That alone is thousands. I will be doing the bulk of the work, as I&#x27;m older and more resposible for how things go. She will be there most of the time, but her job is just as important as mine, she will bring laughter and life. And I will bring attention, and the room commanded under me. My teachers like that as I talk, apparently I &quot;cammand the room&quot; or something. I believe that means the room pays attention, as while I was auditioning, every single person was paying full attention. Most times, they were talking and preparing while others were auditioning.</p>
<p>Anyways, enough about me, I came home and played games till 6:30. I played with my dad and younger brother, it was fun, we got 2mil in the game we were playing. We played some zombie defence game.</p>
<p>Currently 10:00, I will continue telling about what happened. So at 6:50, we went to eat out. IT was tasty, so we came back.</p>
<p>&quot;All warfare is based on deception. Therefore, when capable, feign incapacity; when active, inactivity. When near, make it appear that you are far away; when far away, that you are near. Offer the enemy a bait to lure him; feign disorder and strike him. When he concentrates, prepare against him; where he is strong, avoid him. Anger his general and confuse him. Pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance. Keep him under a strain and wear him down. When he is united, divide him. Attack where he is unprepared; sally out when he does not expect you.</p>
<p>These are the strategist&#x27;s keys to victory. It is not possible to discuss them beforehand. now if the estimates made in the temple before hostilities indicate victory it is because calculations show one&#x27;s strength to be superior to that of his enemy; if they indicate defeat, it is because calculations show that one is inferior. With many calculations, one can win; with few one cannot. How much less chance of victory has one who makes none at all! By this means I examine the situation and the outcome will be clearly apparent.”
― Sun Tzu, The Art of War</p>
<p>That&#x27;s some good advice, if one doesn&#x27;t work, use the other. Also, be optomistic, but one things strikes me as odd. Dont do the calculations, just believe you can do it? Makes sense, because moral effects troops. Defeat in detail is genuis, and concentration of force builds on it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tactics</li>
<li>Operations</li>
<li>Stratagies</li>
</ul>
<p>False gap? Nah, thats just decieving the enemy. Which works, wow. The phalanx is good, but slow and can be countered from attacks on all sides, as turning is it&#x27;s weak point. The maniple is a flexible formation, and can work independant.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hastati<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Young</li>
<li>Normal gear</li>
<li>Would take turns at the front of the maniple with the princepe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Princepe<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Older</li>
<li>Better gear</li>
<li>In the middle, but would swap out with the hastati when needed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Triali<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Oldest</li>
<li>Elite gear</li>
<li>The elite troops</li>
<li>At the back, would be used rarely/in emergencies if required</li>
<li>The last line of defence</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s come to the triali&quot;, the final defence. Similar to the saying, &quot;On our last legs&quot;. I think, but anyways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cohorts</li>
</ul>
<p>A self sufficeint army that is much larger than a maniple, they can do anything, like make a camp, or build bridges. &quot;Are you in cohorts with them?&quot; Are you in cohorts with them? Well, are you in the same group? Are you your own group? Are you grouped with them? Cohorts is even more genuis, they are all the same troops, they can fill in for each other whenever need be.</p>
<p>Currently 10:46, why am I watching military stratagies, it isn&#x27;t bad. Anyways, will eat dinner.</p>
<p><em>Next day, slept.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-6th">April 6th<a href="#april-6th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 6th" title="Direct link to April 6th">​</a></h3>
<p>I woke up, felt tired. But I got up and out of bed because I will get to play games early if I wake up early. I then brushed and went to play games. I played the game, and farmed, and also built many useful buildings. Doing quests is super important, they let you expand your buildings. Also, explore the rocky areas, there are bears and lots of other wildlife. There is deer and moose, they give lots of meat. Remeber to eat the meat before it gets spoiled, cabbage is the best crop early. Cabbage is a great source of food, and grows 4 per plot. Cabbages are a saving grace.</p>
<p>Anyways, currently 11:55, I ate breakfeast then relaxed. After that I exersiced for a bit, did 60 pushups. Six sets of 10, moving on I will study now.</p>
<ul>
<li>2^3 / 2^2 = 2/1 . . . 2</li>
<li>2^3 / 2^2 = 2^(3-2) . . . 2^1 . . . 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Ohh, that makes sense, we substract the exponents in division, but add in mutiplication. Back to work, currently 12:15.</p>
<ul>
<li>25^3 / 5^2 = 15625 / 25 . . . 625</li>
<li>25^3 / 5^2 = (25/5)^4 . . . 5^4 . . . 625</li>
</ul>
<p>But what is the correlation? I&#x27;m not sure, I&#x27;m gonna figure it out.</p>
<ul>
<li>9x^8 / 3x^4 =? (9^8)(x^8) . . . No</li>
<li>9x^8 / 3x^4 = (9<em>x)^8 / (3</em>x)^4 . . . (9/3)x^(8-4) . . . 3x^4</li>
</ul>
<p>That can&#x27;t be right. I will search it up. Turns out this is correct. But why?</p>
<ul>
<li>9x^8 = 3x^4 * 3x^4</li>
</ul>
<p>Because 2^4 * 2^4 = 16*16 = 256 . . . SO:</p>
<ul>
<li>(3x^4 * 3x^4) / 3x^4 = 3x^4</li>
</ul>
<p>You cancel out the numbers to get 3x^4 / 1 . . . or 3x^4 * 1. Wow, that&#x27;s pretty cool to know. Turns out studying really does help, wink wink, nudge nudge. Anyways, I will get back to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>( 4x^5/3 )^3 = (4^3)x^(5/3 * 3) . . . 64x^5</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if you put this through a calculator, you&#x27;d get like (64x^5)/27 or something. Remember that the exponent is gettting divided by three, then times by three.</p>
<p>Just read a sad quote.
&quot;Suicide doesn&#x27;t get rid of the pain, it gives it to someone else&quot;
-Wise Man</p>
<p>Currently 1:00, just relaxing.</p>
<p>SAY: Welcom guys, at today&#x27;s event you will see ... Let me tell you something quickly about how I got on stage in front of you, to be honest with you, I know nothing about playing instruments.</p>
<p>According to lasmanenas9992 on the youtube video by Devon Brown; How To Be A Great Event Emcee (15 Tips From The World&#x27;s #1 Seminar MC)- Devon Brown:</p>
<p>1.- Do your homework at the event.
2.- Remember is about the event, not you.
3.-Come with more energy than the room but not so much you blow them out of the water.
4.-Drees the part
5.-Arrive early and make sure you do your sound check and feel the stage.
6.-Mix with the crowd beforehand.
7.-Script your opening.
8.-talk to the speakers beforehand
9.-Be confident with your mess-ups.
10.-You are an MC, not a comedian.
11.-When you are on stage interact or study with the audience.
12.-Learn how to have filler and learn how to kill time.
13.-Be there for the event host.
14.-End strong as you stared.
15.-Be authentic.</p>
<p>Thank you, this helped a lot.</p>
<p>“The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.” – Mark Twain.</p>
<p>That, I will use for the arts portion. Say it once, say it again and say. &quot;Mark twian said this&quot;. Now if you wan&#x27;t to help children find their lifes joy, their love for life. Then cosider buying an art piece to donate to helping children grow. The money will be split by ms.Mcdonald, and ms.Carter. Art, and music, are very important, they give color to a scociety. So if your intrested in an amazing art piece, and helping the kids, then buy an art piece.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve got this covered!</p>
<p>Currently 3:24, I was just working on how I&#x27;m gonna be like in MC. The concert is for thousands, I am but one person, but I will prevail. Just saw someone stop in front of my window, take out a pair of binoculars, then peer into my window. Why?? His girl was also looking at my window? Keep walking buster, that&#x27;s weird.</p>
<p>I know no one will believe me, but holy heck that is odd. Did I do something wrong? I looked at them, they turned around, as if they knew I was looking at them. Like how?? That&#x27;s odd, anyways, back to work. Notice how wacky stuff happens, back to work.</p>
<p>Currently 3:50, just worked some more, I&#x27;m happy with it for now.</p>
<p>Left at like 5:00, currently 8:15. Went to the park for a bit with my family.</p>
<p>Quote from Rumi - &quot;All your anxiety is because of your desire for harmony. Seek disharmony, then you will gain peace.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Next day, I slept, and wrote random things here.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-7th">April 7th<a href="#april-7th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 7th" title="Direct link to April 7th">​</a></h3>
<p>I think today is my uncles birthday. I will wish him soon, but for now I shall study,</p>
<ul>
<li>(3x^(2/3))^3 = 9x^2</li>
<li>(3x^(2/3))^3 = (3^3)*((x^2/3)^3) . . . 27x^(2/3 * 3) . . . 27x^2</li>
</ul>
<p>Because:</p>
<ul>
<li>(2^2)<em>2 = 4</em>2 . . . 8</li>
<li>(2^2)^2 = 4^2 . . . 16</li>
<li>(2^2)^2 = 2^(2*2) . . . 2^4 . . . 16</li>
</ul>
<p>Get it? It really is so simple, this is very useful. The exponets mutiply, cool. Moving on:</p>
<ul>
<li>√5^2 = 5</li>
<li>√5^2 = √25 . . . 5</li>
<li>25 = 5*5</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright.</p>
<ul>
<li>√4 = 4^(1/2) . . . 2</li>
<li>4 = 2*2</li>
</ul>
<p>So many ways to write things.</p>
<ul>
<li>√4^2 = 4</li>
<li>√4^2 = 4^(2 * 1/2) . . . 4^1 . . . 4</li>
<li>(4^2)^(1/2) = 16^(1/2) = 4</li>
<li>16 = 4*4</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on.</p>
<ul>
<li>√4^4 = 16</li>
<li>(4^4)^(1/2) = (4<em>4</em>4<em>4)^(1/2) . . . . 4</em>4 . . . 16</li>
<li>(4^4)^(1/2) = (256)^1/2 . . . 16</li>
<li>256 = 16*16</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#x27;s funny, I just knew off the top of my head √256 = 16. Anyways, I will continue.</p>
<ul>
<li>√2^8 = 16</li>
<li>√3^10 = 243</li>
<li>√4^8 = 256</li>
<li>√5^4 = 25</li>
<li>√10^10 = 100000</li>
</ul>
<p>But why does this happen? Why do the exponents get divided by half? Because &quot; √ &quot; = ^1/2. So if you exponent another exponent in parenthesis, you have to mutiply it. If:</p>
<ul>
<li>2^2^2 = 4^2 . . . 16</li>
<li>3^3^3 = 27^3 . . . 19683</li>
<li>3^^2 = 3^3^3 . . . 27^3 . . . 19683</li>
</ul>
<p>Off topic, but anyways, back to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>2^2^2 = 2^(2*2) . . . 2^4 . . . 16</li>
<li>3^3^3 = 3^(3*3) . . . 3^9 . . . 19683</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, here is a guess:</p>
<ul>
<li>2^2^2^2^1/2^2^1/4 = 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I will check if my guess is right:</p>
<ul>
<li>2^2^2^2^1/2 ^2^1/4</li>
<li>2^(2<em>2</em>2*(1/2)<em>2</em>(1/4))</li>
<li>2^(2)</li>
<li>2^2 = 4</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, so 2<em>2 = 4. Then 8/2 = 4. Then 4</em>2 = 8. Then 8 * 1/4 = 2</p>
<p>I was wrong, I even checked the calculator, it shows as 4. Dang, but I was close. I think, but moving on, I just simplified it. I said it would be 2, but it was actually 4.</p>
<ul>
