<p>Alright, it&#x27;s April. March was a productive month, even though I didn&#x27;t write much down. This April I will try to be better, as my birthday is on the 12th.  I&#x27;m still in Canada, and I&#x27;m still 13, but this month I will turn fourteen.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-1st-">April 1st. 🔴<a href="#april-1st-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 1st. 🔴" title="Direct link to April 1st. 🔴">​</a></h3>
<p>I woke up, currently 7:55, I will eat breakfeast. Currently 10:11, I&#x27;m frustrated. I will go to the park with my family.</p>
<p>Currently 12:20, I&#x27;m back and will eat lunch.</p>
<p>Ate lunch, was delicious, I am happy. Currently 3:36, I relaxed and just layed on the floor. I then bought a $35, Medieval Dysnasty. The graphics were so life-like I felt like I was the one chopping trees, honestly a good game. I just need to figure out how to do things, it is like minecraft but realistic and unlike any other game. But I liked the graphics and gameplay, anyways, I will do something.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stockpile resources</li>
<li>Don&#x27;t buy from shop, sell to shop</li>
<li>Farm yourself</li>
<li>Have money to pay taxes</li>
<li>Sell tools for profit to pay taxes</li>
<li>Don&#x27;t die</li>
</ul>
<p>These are things you should do in game. Also build a house near a village, easy money and quest access. Currently 4:40, I was just wasting time, I also took out the trash which didn&#x27;t take long. I will study for some time, then exersice.</p>
<ul>
<li>2<em>2</em>2 = 8</li>
<li>2*2^2 = 8</li>
<li>2^3 = 8</li>
<li>4^2</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>2(2)<sup>2</sup> * 3(2)<sup>2</sup> = 6 * 2^4 . . . 6*16 . . . 96 ✔️</li>
</ul>
<p>So</p>
<p>ax<sup>m</sup> * bx<sup>n</sup> =  ab * x<sup>m+n</sup></p>
<p>checks out. This is for multiplying equations with the same base, it seems to work fine.</p>
<ul>
<li>2(2)<sup>2</sup> / 4(2)<sup>2</sup> = 2/4 * 2<sup>2-2</sup> . . . 1/2 * 2<sup>0</sup> . . . 1/2 * 1 . . . 0.5 ✔️</li>
<li>8/16 = 0.5 so yes this is factual.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so</p>
<p>ax<sup>m</sup> / bx<sup>n</sup> =  a/b * x<sup>m-n</sup></p>
<p>This is very helpful if you get a formula based problem, or something that would simplify into this type of equation, time saver. So then what about regular equations:</p>
<ul>
<li>5^2 * 3^2 = 25 * 9 . . . 225</li>
<li>5^2 * 3^2 = 15^2 . . . 225</li>
</ul>
<p>So (5 * 3)^2, I&#x27;m sure you know why. (a*b)^n . Well anyways, currently 5:30, I am just learning. A whole hour passed, I really havent been productive have I, I should pick up the pace.</p>
<ul>
<li>6^2 / 3^2 = (6/3)^2 . . . 2^2 . . . 4</li>
<li>36/9 = 4 this checks out</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently 6:45, I played games for a while. It was the same game I was playing earlier today, I like it, it is too realistic. I also helped my dad with making a video for his website, he on the side made a website. The website is cool, it is about creating online cards for people (but in a much much more fun way). I edited the video and yeah, I got paid $0, but in return he got me the $35 game. I think it was worth it, anyways, he says I should be more entrepenruel. I should try teaching little kids Scratch? I mean I could, it woulden&#x27;t be very hard If I had a plan (I do), but aren&#x27;t there thousands of people teaching scratch? I&#x27;m not even in highschool, but I dunno. I will work on school work, currently 6:55.</p>
<p>Currently 8:00, I wrote some more in my story, then went on a walk. I went with my dad and younger brother, it was good, I&#x27;m now just writing some more. Currently 9:00, I wrote a good amount, I&#x27;m happy with where the stories going. I will read it again, to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any simple mistakes.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-2nd-">April 2nd 🟢<a href="#april-2nd-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 2nd 🟢" title="Direct link to April 2nd 🟢">​</a></h3>
<p>So today I woke up, and then it was super windy. It was 45mph winds, I was getting pushed back.Now I&#x27;ll work on the story. Wrote a little, wasted time, and will now do 100 pushups. Currently 5:22, now 5:55. I spent like a couple minutes looking at myself in the mirror, but yeah, I did the 100 pushups. I went down to fill my bottle in between, doing 10 regular (easy) pushups is now simple. I wan&#x27;t to do other kinds of pushups that target different muscles, I enjoy looking at my arm and seeing muscle. I will now work on writiing the story. And eat food too, yeah.</p>
<p>Currently 6:40, ate some food, will eat more. I finished the rough draft of my asignemtn. I will polish it now, I will work more on it seperatly. Currently like 7:00, (6:58), I will do 50 pushups. I checked, I do not have any homework.</p>
<p>Currently 7:35, I did 80 pushups, wasted time, then punched my weights. Because I wasted time, I punched my weight 50 times, not very had though. I will not play games today, I will study.</p>
<ul>
<li>4<sup>2</sup> * (2<sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = (8<sup>3</sup>)2</li>
<li>16 * 8<sup>2</sup> . . . 16 * 64</li>
<li>16 * 64 = 1024</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, checks out.</p>
<ul>
<li>4 * ((x)^3)*3 + ((2^2) * 0)</li>
<li>4 * 3(x)^3 + 0</li>
<li>4 * 3x^3</li>
<li>12x^3</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on.</p>
<ul>
<li>(4 * 3)^3</li>
<li>(64 * 27)</li>
<li>(12)^3</li>
<li>((6*2)^3)</li>
<li>((((2 + 1)^4)/9) + (3^0 + 2^0 + 1^0))^3((4/3)^0)</li>
<li>(((1 + 1) - ((2^5)/32)) * 12)^3</li>
<li>(((((11*11)/(11^0)+2)/123) + 11)^(33/11))</li>
<li>((((((12)^3) + ((4*3)^3))/1728)*6)^(3((((2 + 1)^4)/9) + (3^0 + 2^0 + 1^0))^3((4/3)^0))/1728)+0</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how they all equal 1728. You can represent things in many ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>(((1728 * 2)/1728) * 6)^3(1728/1728)+0</li>
<li>(2 * 6)^3(1)+0</li>
<li>(12)^3</li>
<li>12^3</li>
<li>1728</li>
</ul>
<p>Get it? Well anyways, the last example is bit tricky, but if you simplify it is isnt very hard.</p>
<ul>
<li>(12*x)^3 = 12x^3</li>
<li>(12*4)^3</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently 9:55, ate dinner, and did 20 pushups. I&#x27;ve done 200 today, nice.</p>
<p><em>Next day, slept.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-3rd-">April 3rd 🔵<a href="#april-3rd-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 3rd 🔵" title="Direct link to April 3rd 🔵">​</a></h3>
<p>Wasted time, dissapointed in myself. I know wasting time is bad, but I wasted time. Currently 5:47, I wasted time, then I exersiced. I did 50 pushups and some random weight things. I will now work on the story, then studey at 6:30. No game today, study yes, yeah. Currently 6:15, worked a little on it. I am wondering no more, to folly is to regret. The regret is folly if preventable, such folly is only regretible beyond the folly of thy&#x27;self. Do thou understand, regret, pain, folly, all burn. To be regretful, or not to be. Such is the folly we all make, choosing the former only leads to pain. Physically and metnally our regret manifests as our enternal follies. But to no avail doth this sensation avail, to be, to be better. Finally, have thou centraly understood that while folly, may be regret, to regret is folly if prefentable. Only doth who do not persue these regretful things will not folly, this is the only way. To do, or not to do? There art&#x27;only not, as to do means regret with entails the folly of pain on oneself which could&#x27;ve been prevnted. But as I preach, I myself am victum to my own folly. As regret sets in, the folly becomes somewhat of a common occurance. I, myself hath known many things about folly, but to implement them in such precousious ways elude me.</p>
<p>Anyways, I will study.</p>
<ul>
<li>(3^(3*2)) = 729</li>
<li>(3^3*2) = 54</li>
<li>(3^3)^2 = 729</li>
<li>3^6 = 729</li>
<li>3^3^2 = 19683</li>
</ul>
<p>Random thing I thought up, it&#x27;s uncanny the exorbant amount of ways you can compose an equation. I will keep studying. Holy wow negative exponents are insane, whoever thought up negative exponents is either a genuis, or someone who wants others to suffer.</p>
<p>Turn weakness into strength, as no one else will do it for you.</p>
<p>I was nervous while auditioning today, but that nervousess made my voice very deep, and rich. I turned nervousness into my strength. I never thought I would be nervous, but to be honest I was a little. I was auditioning today, to be MC (Master of Cerimonies) For the school concert in a month. I think it went pretty well.</p>
<p>Just now, I felt super tired. I&#x27;m drinking some really sour drink, like it is just really sour. It probably isn&#x27;t good for me, I was smoking on a lolipop, I put it down on a tray when I was done. I felt so old, but reality hit, I&#x27;m still a kid. Nice, I will continue studying, and tr to find out this whole negative exponents thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>2^-4 . . . 1/2^4 . . . 1/16</li>

<li>3x^-3 . . . 3 * 1/x^3 . . . 3/x^3</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on:</p>
<ul>
<li>(3^3)/(3^5) = 3^3-5 . . . 3^-2 . . . 1/3^2 . . . 1/9</li>
<li>27/243 = 9/81 . . . 3/27 . . . 1/9</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently 7:06, talked to my mom for a bit. Then did some thinking, I looked up to my ceiling and saw a flower. Then another, after that I saw a whole field of flowers. I thought about bad things, and then two horns and a circle showed up. I agreed in my head, the demonic picture turned into a heart. I felt great, a face showed up, it smiled and wore glasses. It took off the glasses and seemed mor happy the more I agreed with it. I&#x27;ve had a understanding, I need to be better, to do better. I will continue studying.</p>
<p>Just watched a video: &quot;Medieval Dynasty How To Get Seeds , Fertiliser And Wheat Grain Farming Chapter V A Farm Guide 2022&quot;</p>
<p>Super informative, anyways, I will get back to work. Just watched some &quot;how to&#x27;s&quot; about that game. Don&#x27;t really regret it as it is important info, if I waste time on a game, I should at least know how to play.</p>
<p><em>Next day, I slept.</em></p>

<p>For change to be made, change needs to be present. &quot;I&#x27;m getting better&quot;, Not, &quot;I&#x27;m the best&quot;.</p>
<p>Do you wan&#x27;t to be better, then change, be present in the procces of changing. Learn from mistakes, explore, get better.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2^-4)/(2^-3) = 1/2^4 / 1/2^3 . . . (1/16) / (1/8) . . . 1/2</li>
<li>(1/16) * 16 . . . 16/16 . . . 1</li>
<li>(1/8) * 16 . . . 16/8 . . . 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Get it? Because the negative exponents was simplified, then I simplified it even further. This is amazing, is it very simple. Exponents are just another exponantial increase of a value. The value with a exponent with one less will be &quot;value&quot; times less than it.</p>
<ul>
<li>2^-4 = 1/16</li>
<li>2^-3 = 1/8</li>
</ul>
<p>It is greater than the less than in terms of less value.</p>
<ul>
<li>2^4 = 16</li>
<li>2^3 = 8</li>
</ul>
<p>And</p>
<ul>
<li>(2^4)/(2^3) = 2^4 / 2^3 . . . 16 / 8 . . . 2/1</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you see how it inverts? How the negative makes it the opposite? This is very cool, I see how the same pricipales apply, just inverted.</p>
<p>Anyways, currently 7:43, before writing all this, I played games till 6:30. I then talked with my dad till like 7 something. I planted seeds in that game, it was so easy. Buy seeds from vilager, then buy fertalizer. Afterwards hoe the area, then fertalize, then plant seeds after hoeing one more time. How to buy seeds? Make stone knives, sell stone knives, by switching tabs. Then using the money from selling, buy the things. Simple, so yeah I will continue studying.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>(2^-4)/(2^-3) = 1/2^4 / 1/2^3 . . . (1/16) / (1/8) . . . (1/16) * (8/1) . . . 8/16 . . . 1/2</li>
<li>1/2 * 2/1 = (1<em>2)/2 * 1/(2</em>1) . . . 2/2 * 1/2</li>
<li>2/2 * 1/2 = (2<em>1)/2 * (2</em>1)/2 . . . 2/2 * 2/2 . . . 1 * 1</li>
<li>1 * 1 = 1</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x27;m sure you already understood that though. 2 * 1/2 = 2/1 * 2/2 . . . 2/2 . . . 1</p>
<ul>
<li>You can also flip the divsion to make it multiplication. Flip the one that is being the divider.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways.</p>
<ul>
<li>3^0 = 1</li>
</ul>
<p>Why? Because 3*0 = 0. But we are talking about exponents, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>3^1 = 3</li>
<li>3^2 = 3*3 . . . 9</li>
<li>3^3 = 3<em>3</em>3 . . . 27</li>
<li>3^4 = 3<em>3</em>3*3 . . . 81</li>
<li>3^5 = 3<em>3</em>3<em>3</em>3 . . . 243</li>
<li>And so on...</li>
</ul>
<p>What do these have in common? They all increase exponentially by the exponent it was given. So what about zero?</p>
<ul>
<li>It would not be 3, or 0. Beacause it is not mutiplication based, that is the aftermath</li>
<li>3 * nothing? No</li>
<li>Nothing? No</li>
<li>It would be divided into as many parts as it can that isn&#x27;t zero.</li>
<li>1+1+1 = 3*1 = 3^1?</li>
<li>Nah, can&#x27;t be that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x27;m also stumpted, but I&#x27;ll think on it. Based on what we known, zero is nothing. But zero cannot be zero in the case of there being value applied to it. But we all know 3*0 is 0, so what about exponents? I just searched it up, it&#x27;s genuis.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 * 3 = 3</li>
<li>3 = 3</li>
</ul>
<p>One as a mutiplication value, is non-existant. Such as zero is believed to be, so in the case of 1 being the exponent. The other mutiplicative is shown, but since nothing is being shown, nothing is being mutiplied, meaning 1 stands alone.</p>
<ul>
<li>3*1 = 3</li>
<li>but what if there was no 3?</li>
<li>1 = 1</li>
</ul>
<p>So that is why, because with the abcense of value, zero is there to multiply. Now, I don&#x27;t know everything but I do know that this makes sense. Something ^0 is just that exponetiaed by nothing. So soley one remains, the value is gone, only one remains. Just think of it as &quot;nothing&quot; is mutiplication being present. One is the zero of mutiplication, zero is nothing, and as nothing cannot be something, even if fed something. 3*0 = 0.</p>
<p>Whoever thought this up is very smart, I cannot believe anyone had the brains to figure out that the property of 1 in mutiplication is almost zero in terms of things. Anyways, I will eat dinner. Currently 8:06.</p>
<p><em>Next day, slept.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-5th-">April 5th ⚫<a href="#april-5th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 5th ⚫" title="Direct link to April 5th ⚫">​</a></h3>
<p>When I get back from school, there are things I need to do.</p>
<p>6:50</p>
<p>Now 8:15. I went to school, they released the info about who the MC (master of cermimonies) was gonna be. Guess what? It&#x27;s me!!! There were like 12-15 people, only 2 were chosen. Some 7th grade girl, and me were chosen. She is high energy, and I&#x27;m serious and proffesinal. I was chosen because they liked my deep (rich) voice, and how professinal I was. They also said I should smile a little. The girl was chosen because they most liekly wanted to have one girl one boy. If that wasn&#x27;t the case, shaan would&#x27;ve been picked. I wanted to be MC with shaan, but as situation has it, it wasn&#x27;t meant to be. But the girl is very high-energy, so we will contrast each other.</p>
<p>Anyways, I am shocked that I got picked. I will be the MC for a concert of thousands of people. There are 1000-ish students in our school, their parents will be coming. Guests will be coming, friends and family will be coming, and also teachers. That alone is thousands. I will be doing the bulk of the work, as I&#x27;m older and more resposible for how things go. She will be there most of the time, but her job is just as important as mine, she will bring laughter and life. And I will bring attention, and the room commanded under me. My teachers like that as I talk, apparently I &quot;cammand the room&quot; or something. I believe that means the room pays attention, as while I was auditioning, every single person was paying full attention. Most times, they were talking and preparing while others were auditioning.</p>
<p>Anyways, enough about me, I came home and played games till 6:30. I played with my dad and younger brother, it was fun, we got 2mil in the game we were playing. We played some zombie defence game.</p>
<p>Currently 10:00, I will continue telling about what happened. So at 6:50, we went to eat out. IT was tasty, so we came back.</p>
<p>&quot;All warfare is based on deception. Therefore, when capable, feign incapacity; when active, inactivity. When near, make it appear that you are far away; when far away, that you are near. Offer the enemy a bait to lure him; feign disorder and strike him. When he concentrates, prepare against him; where he is strong, avoid him. Anger his general and confuse him. Pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance. Keep him under a strain and wear him down. When he is united, divide him. Attack where he is unprepared; sally out when he does not expect you.</p>
<p>These are the strategist&#x27;s keys to victory. It is not possible to discuss them beforehand. now if the estimates made in the temple before hostilities indicate victory it is because calculations show one&#x27;s strength to be superior to that of his enemy; if they indicate defeat, it is because calculations show that one is inferior. With many calculations, one can win; with few one cannot. How much less chance of victory has one who makes none at all! By this means I examine the situation and the outcome will be clearly apparent.”
― Sun Tzu, The Art of War</p>
<p>That&#x27;s some good advice, if one doesn&#x27;t work, use the other. Also, be optomistic, but one things strikes me as odd. Dont do the calculations, just believe you can do it? Makes sense, because moral effects troops. Defeat in detail is genuis, and concentration of force builds on it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tactics</li>
<li>Operations</li>
<li>Stratagies</li>
</ul>
<p>False gap? Nah, thats just decieving the enemy. Which works, wow. The phalanx is good, but slow and can be countered from attacks on all sides, as turning is it&#x27;s weak point. The maniple is a flexible formation, and can work independant.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hastati<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Young</li>
<li>Normal gear</li>
<li>Would take turns at the front of the maniple with the princepe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Princepe<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Older</li>
<li>Better gear</li>
<li>In the middle, but would swap out with the hastati when needed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Triali<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Oldest</li>
<li>Elite gear</li>
<li>The elite troops</li>
<li>At the back, would be used rarely/in emergencies if required</li>
<li>The last line of defence</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s come to the triali&quot;, the final defence. Similar to the saying, &quot;On our last legs&quot;. I think, but anyways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cohorts</li>
</ul>
<p>A self sufficeint army that is much larger than a maniple, they can do anything, like make a camp, or build bridges. &quot;Are you in cohorts with them?&quot; Are you in cohorts with them? Well, are you in the same group? Are you your own group? Are you grouped with them? Cohorts is even more genuis, they are all the same troops, they can fill in for each other whenever need be.</p>
<p>Currently 10:46, why am I watching military stratagies, it isn&#x27;t bad. Anyways, will eat dinner.</p>
<p><em>Next day, slept.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-6th-">April 6th ⚪<a href="#april-6th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 6th ⚪" title="Direct link to April 6th ⚪">​</a></h3>
<p>I woke up, felt tired. But I got up and out of bed because I will get to play games early if I wake up early. I then brushed and went to play games. I played the game, and farmed, and also built many useful buildings. Doing quests is super important, they let you expand your buildings. Also, explore the rocky areas, there are bears and lots of other wildlife. There is deer and moose, they give lots of meat. Remeber to eat the meat before it gets spoiled, cabbage is the best crop early. Cabbage is a great source of food, and grows 4 per plot. Cabbages are a saving grace.</p>
<p>Anyways, currently 11:55, I ate breakfeast then relaxed. After that I exersiced for a bit, did 60 pushups. Six sets of 10, moving on I will study now.</p>
<ul>
<li>2^3 / 2^2 = 2/1 . . . 2</li>
<li>2^3 / 2^2 = 2^(3-2) . . . 2^1 . . . 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Ohh, that makes sense, we substract the exponents in division, but add in mutiplication. Back to work, currently 12:15.</p>
<ul>
<li>25^3 / 5^2 = 15625 / 25 . . . 625</li>
<li>25^3 / 5^2 = (25/5)^4 . . . 5^4 . . . 625</li>
</ul>
<p>But what is the correlation? I&#x27;m not sure, I&#x27;m gonna figure it out.</p>
<ul>
<li>9x^8 / 3x^4 =? (9^8)(x^8) . . . No</li>
<li>9x^8 / 3x^4 = (9<em>x)^8 / (3</em>x)^4 . . . (9/3)x^(8-4) . . . 3x^4</li>
</ul>
<p>That can&#x27;t be right. I will search it up. Turns out this is correct. But why?</p>
<ul>
<li>9x^8 = 3x^4 * 3x^4</li>
</ul>
<p>Because 2^4 * 2^4 = 16*16 = 256 . . . SO:</p>
<ul>
<li>(3x^4 * 3x^4) / 3x^4 = 3x^4</li>
</ul>
<p>You cancel out the numbers to get 3x^4 / 1 . . . or 3x^4 * 1. Wow, that&#x27;s pretty cool to know. Turns out studying really does help, wink wink, nudge nudge. Anyways, I will get back to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>( 4x^5/3 )^3 = (4^3)x^(5/3 * 3) . . . 64x^5</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if you put this through a calculator, you&#x27;d get like (64x^5)/27 or something. Remember that the exponent is gettting divided by three, then times by three.</p>
<p>Just read a sad quote.
&quot;Suicide doesn&#x27;t get rid of the pain, it gives it to someone else&quot;
-Wise Man</p>
<p>Currently 1:00, just relaxing.</p>
<p>SAY: Welcom guys, at today&#x27;s event you will see ... Let me tell you something quickly about how I got on stage in front of you, to be honest with you, I know nothing about playing instruments.</p>
<p>According to lasmanenas9992 on the youtube video by Devon Brown; How To Be A Great Event Emcee (15 Tips From The World&#x27;s #1 Seminar MC)- Devon Brown:</p>
<p>1.- Do your homework at the event.
2.- Remember is about the event, not you.
3.-Come with more energy than the room but not so much you blow them out of the water.
4.-Drees the part
5.-Arrive early and make sure you do your sound check and feel the stage.
6.-Mix with the crowd beforehand.
7.-Script your opening.
8.-talk to the speakers beforehand
9.-Be confident with your mess-ups.
10.-You are an MC, not a comedian.
11.-When you are on stage interact or study with the audience.
12.-Learn how to have filler and learn how to kill time.
13.-Be there for the event host.
14.-End strong as you stared.
15.-Be authentic.</p>
<p>Thank you, this helped a lot.</p>
<p>“The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.” – Mark Twain.</p>
<p>That, I will use for the arts portion. Say it once, say it again and say. &quot;Mark twian said this&quot;. Now if you wan&#x27;t to help children find their lifes joy, their love for life. Then cosider buying an art piece to donate to helping children grow. The money will be split by ms.Mcdonald, and ms.Carter. Art, and music, are very important, they give color to a scociety. So if your intrested in an amazing art piece, and helping the kids, then buy an art piece.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve got this covered!</p>
<p>Currently 3:24, I was just working on how I&#x27;m gonna be like in MC. The concert is for thousands, I am but one person, but I will prevail. Just saw someone stop in front of my window, take out a pair of binoculars, then peer into my window. Why?? His girl was also looking at my window? Keep walking buster, that&#x27;s weird.</p>
<p>I know no one will believe me, but holy heck that is odd. Did I do something wrong? I looked at them, they turned around, as if they knew I was looking at them. Like how?? That&#x27;s odd, anyways, back to work. Notice how wacky stuff happens, back to work.</p>
<p>Currently 3:50, just worked some more, I&#x27;m happy with it for now.</p>
<p>Left at like 5:00, currently 8:15. Went to the park for a bit with my family.</p>

<p>I think today is my uncles birthday. I will wish him soon, but for now I shall study,</p>
<ul>
<li>(3x^(2/3))^3 = 9x^2</li>
<li>(3x^(2/3))^3 = (3^3)*((x^2/3)^3) . . . 27x^(2/3 * 3) . . . 27x^2</li>
</ul>
<p>Because:</p>
<ul>
<li>(2^2)*2 = 4*2 . . . 8</li>
<li>(2^2)^2 = 4^2 . . . 16</li>
<li>(2^2)^2 = 2^(2*2) . . . 2^4 . . . 16</li>
</ul>
<p>Get it? It really is so simple, this is very useful. The exponets mutiply, cool. Moving on:</p>
<ul>
<li>√5^2 = 5</li>
<li>√5^2 = √25 . . . 5</li>
<li>25 = 5*5</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright.</p>
<ul>
<li>√4 = 4^(1/2) . . . 2</li>
<li>4 = 2*2</li>
</ul>
<p>So many ways to write things.</p>
<ul>
<li>√4^2 = 4</li>
<li>√4^2 = 4^(2 * 1/2) . . . 4^1 . . . 4</li>
<li>(4^2)^(1/2) = 16^(1/2) = 4</li>
<li>16 = 4*4</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on.</p>
<ul>
<li>√4^4 = 16</li>
<li>(4^4)^(1/2) = (4*4*4*4)^(1/2) . . . . 4*4 . . . 16</li>
<li>(4^4)^(1/2) = (256)^1/2 . . . 16</li>
<li>256 = 16*16</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#x27;s funny, I just knew off the top of my head √256 = 16. Anyways, I will continue.</p>
<ul>
<li>√2^8 = 16</li>
<li>√3^10 = 243</li>
<li>√4^8 = 256</li>
<li>√5^4 = 25</li>
<li>√10^10 = 100000</li>
</ul>
<p>But why does this happen? Why do the exponents get divided by half? Because &quot; √ &quot; = ^1/2. So if you exponent another exponent in parenthesis, you have to mutiply it. If:</p>
<ul>
<li>2^2^2 = 4^2 . . . 16</li>
<li>3^3^3 = 27^3 . . . 19683</li>
<li>3^^2 = 3^3^3 . . . 27^3 . . . 19683</li>
</ul>
<p>Off topic, but anyways, back to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>2^2^2 = 2^(2*2) . . . 2^4 . . . 16</li>
<li>3^3^3 = 3^(3*3) . . . 3^9 . . . 19683</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, here is a guess:</p>
<ul>
<li>2^2^2^2^1/2^2^1/4 = 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I will check if my guess is right:</p>
<ul>
<li>2^2^2^2^1/2 ^2^1/4</li>
<li>2^(2<em>2</em>2*(1/2)<em>2</em>(1/4))</li>
<li>2^(2)</li>
<li>2^2 = 4</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, so 2<em>2 = 4. Then 8/2 = 4. Then 4</em>2 = 8. Then 8 * 1/4 = 2</p>
<p>I was wrong, I even checked the calculator, it shows as 4. Dang, but I was close. I think, but moving on, I just simplified it. I said it would be 2, but it was actually 4.</p>
<ul>
<li>(3√)5^9 = 5^3 . . . 5<em>5</em>5 . . . 25*5 . . . 125</li>
</ul>
<p>This is cube root of 5^9. I do not know hwo to represrnt cube root, so I just made something up. I guess you could repsent it as ^3√. Back to work, I ate breakfeast. Currently 9:45, I won&#x27;t exersice on a full stomach.</p>
<p>Currently 10:13, restarted my computer so it&#x27;d run faster. I exersiced in the meantime, 50 pushups, it isn&#x27;t that hard now. I don&#x27;t know what to do now. I do not wan&#x27;t to waste time, I will work on my MC script for the school concert.</p>
<p>Just thought up something random, 2 quotes from me:</p>
<p>The world doesn&#x27;t weigh heavy on me, my own thoughts do.</p>
<p>Cherish what you see, for you could never see it again.</p>
<p>Alright currently 11:01, I was not wasting time. I read up a little on how to be an emcee, be confident, after all you are cool. Currently 11:55, talked to my grandparents, and my great-grandma. I also wished my uncle happy birthday, I will do something now. After doing something, currently 12:34, I exersiced and relaxed. I did 50 pushups, light-work, starting to get the hang of it! Anyways, I will relax some more.</p>
<ul>
<li>30</li>
<li>50</li>
<li>40</li>
<li>50</li>
<li>20</li>
<li>10</li>
<li>10</li>
<li>10</li>
<li>30</li>
<li>30</li>
<li>FINAL: 280</li>
</ul>
<p>According to a youtube video, I&#x27;m 21. No I am not, anyways, I&#x27;ll eat lunch. Currently 1:57, I ate lunch, relaxed, did 50 pushups, then relaxed again. I&#x27;ve done 150 so far today.</p>
<p>Currently 6:15, back from the airport. I relaxed, wasted time, and relised something. I also exersiced with 50 pushups, that&#x27;s 200 today. I relised.</p>
<p>I am curious no more, for my curiosity has lead to finding. Finding made me lose curiosity, and gain wonder, and wonder is safe curiosity.</p>
<p>If you understand, cool. If you don&#x27;t then you have not experianced some things, or maybe my phrase is too vague. It is just how I feel like, inside y&#x27;know. Anyways, I will study till dinner.</p>
<ul>
<li>√2 * √8 = √16 . . . 4</li>
<li>( (√8) / (√2) ) = √(8/2) . . . √4 . . . 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you see how it is? Two times eight = sixteen. And eight divided by two is four. The square root of 4 is 2. This is basic apparently.</p>
<ul>
<li>4^(5/2) = √4^5 . . . √1024 . . . 32</li>
<li>9^(1/2) = √9 . . . 3</li>
<li>8^(1/3) = (3√)8 . . . 2</li>
<li>8 = 2<em>2</em>2</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you notice the way &quot; √ &quot; and &quot; ^ &quot; exist together? I will continue.</p>
<ul>
<li>4^(3/2) * (3√)8 = √4^3 * (2) . . . √64 * 2 . . . 8 * 2 . . . 16</li>
<li>√(√(√√16 * √16^2)^2)^2 = 32</li>
</ul>
<p>But how is that absurd looking thing 32?</p>
<ul>
<li>√√16 = √(√16) . . . √(4) . . . 2</li>
<li>√16^2 = √256 . . . 16</li>
<li>2 * 16 = 32</li>
</ul>
<p>Get it? Because:</p>
<ul>
<li>√x^2 = x</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything &quot; √ &quot; and &quot; ^2 &quot; cancel each other out. Just like:</p>
<ul>
<li>2(3)/2 = 6/2 . . . 3</li>
<li>2(3)/2 = 2(1.5) . . . 3</li>
</ul>
<p>They cancel each other out, but in the case of fractions they don&#x27;t.</p>
<ul>
<li>√4^-2 = √1/4^2 . . . √1/16 . . . 1/4</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure, but 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. So I do believe that 0.0625 or 1/16&#x27;s square root is 1/4. But how can something&#x27;s square root be larger than what was put in? I do not understand, but I will leave it at that.</p>
<ul>
<li>-(√((-(8*2)^(1/2) * √5^2) * √√625)) = 10</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it is ten, I just guessed, but lets find out.</p>
<ul>
<li>-(√((-(8*2)^(1/2) * √5^2) * √√625)) . . . -(√((-(16)^(1/2) * √25) * √√625))</li>
<li>-(√((√(-16) * 5) * √√625)) . . . -√((-4 * 5) * √√(25*25))</li>
<li>-(√((-20) * √25)) . . . -(√(-20 * 5)) . . . -(√(-100))</li>
<li>√(100) . . . 10</li>
<li>10</li>
</ul>
<p>I was indeed correct, now I will use a calculator to find out if I was correct. I don&#x27;t know, it didn&#x27;t return anything properly, it showed -10. I hope I didn&#x27;t make a blunder, no, I checked again, I am correct. Currently 7:17, I will continue.</p>
<ul>
<li>3^2 * 4<em>2 = (3</em>4)^2 . . . 12^2 . . . 144</li>
<li>3^2 * 4*2 = 9 * 16 . . . 144</li>
<li>3^2 * 4<em>2 = ((3</em>4)(3-4))^2 . . . (12*-1)^2 . . . (-12)*(-12) . . . 144</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on.</p>
<ul>
<li>√(3x + 7) = 7</li>
</ul>
<p>Find x? Well how do we find x? It looks hard!!! JK, it is not.</p>
<ul>
<li>√(3x + 7) = 7</li>
<li>√(3x + 7)^2 = 7^2 . . . 3x + 7 = 49</li>
<li>(3x + 7) - 7 = (49) - 7 . . . 42</li>
<li>3x = 42</li>
<li>(3x)/3 = (42)/3 . . . 14</li>
<li>42 = 6*7 OR 3*14</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus x = 14. Get it? Simple right, well you just need to not panick while seeing stuff like this. I panicked as soon as I saw this, I was like &quot;no idea&quot;. But relised that it is super easy, just do some stuff. Currently 7:30, I will take a break. Currently 7:45 exactly, back from jst talking to my parents. I helped my mom prepare potatoes, I also did 30 pushups and ate a small sized Mars bar. Mars candy bars have got to be my favorite, I also really like twix. I would choose mars over twix though, twix is somewhat cheeper feeling than mars. Mars is like fine dining candy bars, kinda like Ghirardelli or Godiva or See&#x27;s candies. I like candy, but at the same time I like my health. So eat candy, but workout. Yes, back to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>5x^4 * 3x^8 = (5*3) * x^(4+8) . . . 15x^12</li>
</ul>
<p>Get it? Anyways.</p>
<ul>
<li>(x^2)^(1/2) = x^(2*(1/2)) . . . x^1 . . . x</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>x^(y/2) = 100</li>
</ul>
<p>What is a possible value for &quot; y &quot;?</p>
<ul>
<li>y(1) = 10000^(1/2) . . . √(100 * 100) . . . 100 <em><strong>✔️</strong></em></li>
<li>y(2) = 100^(2/2) . . . 100^1 . . . 100 <em><strong>✔️</strong></em></li>
<li>y(3/2) <em><strong>≈</strong></em> 21.5^(3/2) . . . 100 ✓</li>
<li>y(4) = 10^(4/2) . . . 10^2 <em><strong>✔️</strong></em></li>
<li>ETC...</li>
</ul>
<p>You get the point, but there are lot&#x27;s of possible values for y. Now what if I say make &quot; x &quot; a mutiple of 5?</p>
<ul>
<li>5|x &amp; y(5.7) <em><strong>≈</strong></em> 5^(5.7/2) . . . 5^(2.85) . . . 100 ✓</li>
<li>5|x &amp; y(2) = 100^(2/2) . . . 100^1 . . . 100 <strong>✔️</strong></li>
<li>5|x &amp; y(4) = 10^(4/2) . . . 10^2 . . . 10 <strong>✔️</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I do not know what &quot; | &quot; means, but I think it means to &quot;this divides this&quot;. What if I add another rule, make y a whole number!</p>
<ul>
<li>5|x &amp; ((y=2)%1 = 0) = 100^(2/2) . . . 100^1 . . . 100 <strong>✔️</strong></li>
<li>5|x &amp; ((y=4)%1 = 0) = 10^(4/2) . . . 10^2 . . . 10 <strong>✔️</strong></li>
<li>5|x &amp; ((y=1)%1 = 0) = 10000^(1/2) . . . √(100 * 100) . . . 100 <em><strong>✔️</strong></em></li>
<li>5|x &amp; ((y=5)%1 = 0) <em><strong>≈</strong></em> 6.3^(5/2) . . . 100 ✓</li>
<li>5|x &amp; ((y=6)%1 = 0) <em><strong>≈</strong></em> 4.6^(6/2) . . . 100 ✓</li>
</ul>
<p>Cool, I&#x27;m not entirely sure what &quot; % &quot; does, but I get the idea. Another rule: Both x and y have to be a whole number!!! Oh no! Now remove the rule about &quot;make x a mutiple of 5&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>((x=100)%1 = 0) &amp; ((y=2)%1 = 0) = 100^(2/2) . . . 100^1 . . . 100 <strong>✔️</strong></li>
<li>((x=10)%1 = 0) &amp; ((y=4)%1 = 0) = 10^(4/2) . . . 10^2 . . . 10 <strong>✔️</strong></li>
<li>((x=1000)%1 = 0) &amp; ((y=1)%1 = 0) = 10000^(1/2) . . . √(100 * 100) . . . 100 <em><strong>✔️</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Enough of that, very random. I will... do something. Currently 8:30, time flew wow. To study, or not to study? The real question is how to relax. I will relax for a bit, done 230 pushups today, happy with myself about that.</p>
<p>By the way, figured out that girl from valentines was joking. Man that sucked, apparently she tells that to every guy, I &quot;rejected her&quot;, but if I had accepted I would&#x27;ve been made fun of. Damn, that sucks, she led me on. /(<em>_</em>)\</p>
<p>I am tall, handsome, and have muscles, but yet I got led on. Maybe..? No, she just was one of those people you meet in life. Maybe she was serious? No, she is known for trolling, pretty as she may be. It&#x27;s not worth thinking about things that bring you pain, think about why you felt pain so you may never experience it again.</p>
<p>Be not scared of feeling that pain again, be scared of not knowing why.</p>
<p>Currently 9:30-ish, ate dinner, it was tasty. I ate shrimp and stuff, I also cleaned my room a little and set my bed. I will brush now. Watching random youtube videos is entertaining, but honestly, it&#x27;s entertaining.</p>
<p><em>Next day, slept.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-8th-">April 8th 🟠<a href="#april-8th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 8th 🟠" title="Direct link to April 8th 🟠">​</a></h3>
<p>I got out of bbed at 7:30, now 7:45. I will relax, now 8:00, relaxing some more. Currently 8:15, I am bored, not sure what to do. Currently 8:30, will study.</p>
<ul>
<li>n^(1/3) = x</li>
</ul>
<p>What is n? I dunno.</p>
<ul>
<li>n^(1/3) = x</li>
<li>((1/3)√)n^(1/3) = ((1/3)√)x</li>
<li>n = ((1/3)√)x</li>
<li>n = x^3</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets gooo, I was correct! Kinda took a random approach using the stuff I learned yesterday, it works though? Negative ver:</p>
<ul>
<li>n^(-1/3) = x</li>
<li>((-1/3)√)n^(-1/3) = ((-1/3)√)x</li>
<li>n = ((-1/3)√)x</li>
<li>n = x^-3</li>
<li>n = 1/x^3</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x27;m 80% sure this is correct, again, just kinda did something and it seemed to have worked.</p>
<ul>
<li>n^(-1/3) = x</li>
<li>(n^(-1/3))^-3 = (x)^-3</li>
<li>n^(-1/3 * -3/1) = x^-3</li>
<li>n^(1) = x^-3</li>
<li>n = x^-3</li>
<li>n = 1/x^3</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a better approach, this works fine. The other thing is iffy, this works. I made &quot; -1/3 &quot; into 1 by exponentiating it by &quot; -3 &quot;. Because as you know, when one exponent is exponetiated outside the parenthisis, it gets timed. So -1/3 * -3. Which is 1, so n^1. I just did the same to x, and then formatted it correctly by writing the &quot;-exponetiafyed&quot; x. Now for the most part, I don&#x27;t know the words I&#x27;m using, but I&#x27;ll figure them out.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#x27;s so easy doing problems here, because I can explain my thinking much better thsn with a pencil or pen. I don&#x27;t know, but questions I can&#x27;t do on paper I can do in my head or by typing it down. No, I just need to practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on.</p>
<ul>
<li>x^-2 = 1/x^2</li>
<li>So does that mean:</li>
<li>4^-2 = 1/4^2 . . . 1/16</li>
</ul>
<p>Wow, cool, so I can format things is many ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>(((1/3^2) + (3^-2))<em>4) + 2/6</em>3 = 1</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I just wrote down some random equation I thought of.</p>
<ul>
<li>(((1/3^2) + (3^-2))<em>4) + 2/6</em>3 . . . (((1/9) + (1/3^2))*4) + 2/18</li>
<li>(((1/9) + (1/9))*4) + 1/9 . . . ((2/9)*4) + 1/9</li>
<li>(2*4/9) + 1/9 . . . (8/9) + 1/9 . . . 8/9 + 1/9</li>
<li>8/9 + 1/9 . . . 1</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, since I made the question, I already know how to solve it. But still, breaking it apart and seeing how we got from point a to b is still fun. When you see some complex looking equation, do not be scared, as they are all numbers. Do not be scared of x and y, they are numbers/values too. Anyways, I will continue. Currently 9:00, yeah.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is time going by so fast? Jan took forever, feb was in a blink of an eye. March, I just went through the days, exersiced, but barely studied. I don&#x27;t understand, why am I progressing so quick, life is it making me grow up? Maybe I&#x27;m going slowly, and others are going fast. As I feel fast, I feel fast because I do not know the value of one day. I need to slow down, enjoy being a kid, and grow. It&#x27;s already april 8th, my birthday is april 12. I will turn 14 soon, damn. Every day, I never thought I&#x27;d go to highschool, it seemed distant, far. But as I progress the reality of whats coming does not elude me, as I am a person who thinks of the future. The future thinks of me? I will go to highschool soon, it seemed so far, now too close. I&#x27;m growing up, but my peers mostly aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s hard to be around immature people, even being tall and strong doesn&#x27;t save you from dumb people doing dumb things. I like people who are mature, you can have good conversations, and actually have a productive conversation. But to honest, 50% of guys at my school are gay, I don&#x27;t mind. But to honest, I dislike them saying weird things. It makes me uncomfortable, but as I am one man, what can I do? If so many are odd, then the many who aren&#x27;t where are they? Touching people is weird, but is common now. Anyways, back on topic. School, it&#x27;s making the guys around me weak, it&#x27;s tangible. The girls are all sassy, fat, or the most polite people you&#x27;ve met. That is a 1:3 for polite people to not polite people. I enjoy talking to polite people, I make jokes, I&#x27;m not afraid to be loud in class. They&#x27;re all cowards, but to be honest, aren&#x27;t I? As I&#x27;m also a school kids, can I say I&#x27;m not weak? No, but they infuriate me with weakness and immaturity. Maybe I&#x27;m immature for disliking unpolite people, but I got so mad on friday when I noticed how meek my classmates are. California was different, people weren&#x27;t scared to be loud, it was encouraged. &quot;Your american, your loud&quot;, &quot;your afraid to be loud&quot;, &quot;Stop yapping&quot;, they need to grow up. All my teachers like me, why? I try my best to be the best, polite, strong, and good. But that&#x27;s not enough as I.. no, venting doen&#x27;t help. It&#x27;s bad for me and you. I like hanging around big kids, they are more mature, some of them. Back in california, I was smoking a taki in a bus. It was weird, but I had fun with highschoolers, went to games, hung out with them. I enjoy spending time with those I percieve better than me, as I can learn. What I learned from them, is not to duck up your life, be better as no one will make you. But, can I be better? Yeah, do I want to? Yes, so how? How do I become better? &quot;Keep walking the road of life, you&#x27;ll find it eventually.&quot; I do not wan&#x27;t to wait? &quot;Those with patience get everything.&quot; No, no, why not now? &quot;You need to learn.&quot; What? The things in school!? They don&#x27;t help, only 20% actually benifits me, but I suppose that&#x27;s better than 0% by yourself? No, I learn great by myself. &quot;Everyone needs help.&quot; But why? &quot; . . . &quot; Never mind, I&#x27;ll just get back to work.</li>
</ul>
<p>That was a lot of random things, ignore that. Back to work. I don&#x27;t smoke, a friend just lit a taki on fire and I &quot;smoked&quot; it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently 9:20, gonna eat breakfeast.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently 10:00 exactly, I ate pancakes. As I walked into my room I saw a woman trying to walk, and a man pushing her/stopping her from going. It seemed like she was fed up with him and wanted to leave, she tried pushing him but he just stood there. I think they got into a quarel and she decided to leave, she retreated after the man wouldn&#x27;t let her leave. She walked back into the house, I hope she is fine. The guy seems not very great to be honest, pushing women? No no, she is leaving and its your fault, why push/block her? I dunno, maybe I don&#x27;t understand, but still. Anyways, I&#x27;ll study for a bit.</p>
<ul>
<li>√x = x^(1/2)</li>
<li>-√x =? x^(-1/2)</li>
</ul>
<p>If √x = x^(1/2) then does -√x = x^(-1/2)? I dont know, but I think so.</p>
<ul>
<li>√4 = 4^(1/2) . . . (2*2)^(1/2) . . . 2 ✓</li>
<li>-√4 = 4^(-1/2) . . . 1/4^(1/2) . . . 1/√4 . . . 1/2 . . . 0.5 ✓</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets goo, so using common sense, I just used the pricipals of negative exponents and applied it here.</p>
<ul>
<li>4^-1 = 1/4^1 . . . 1/4 ✓</li>
<li>2(4^-1)^2 = 2(1/4^1)^2 . . . 2(1/4)^2 . . . 2(1/4*1/4) . . . 2(1/16) . . . 2/16 . . . 1/8 ✓</li>
</ul>
<p>Just checked google, I was correct. Pemdas, bedmas, they all get to 1/8 in this equation. Moving on.</p>
<ul>
<li>((3√)8x^8 * y^6) / √(4x^2 * y^6) = ?</li>
</ul>
<p>How do we even simplify this?? This looks really hard, I have no clue. First of all, lets get something clear.</p>
<ul>
<li>4 / √4 = 4 * 4^(-1/2)</li>
<li>4 / √4 = 4/2 . . . 2 ✓</li>
<li>4 * 4^(-1/2) = 4 * 1/4^1/2 . . . 4 * 1/√4 . . . 4 * 1/2 . . . 2 ✓</li>
</ul>
<p>No way this works, nice. I just guessed but lets go it works.</p>
<ul>
<li>(3√)8 = 8^(1/3)</li>
<li>(3√)8 = 2 ✓</li>
<li>8^(1/3) = (3√)8 . . . 2 ✓</li>
</ul>
<p>Now to solve the question:</p>
<ul>
<li>((3√)8x^8 * y^6) / √(4x^2 * y^6) = ?</li>
</ul>
<p>After trying and failing, I just decided to look at the answer. IT was so complex, but I understood why they did what they did.</p>
<ul>
<li>((3√)8x^8 * y^6) / √(4x^2 * y^6) = (((3√)8 * (3√)x^8 * (3√)y^6) / (√4 * √x^2 * √y^6))</li>
<li>(((3√)8 * (3√)x^8 * (3√)y^6) / (√4 * √x^2 * √y^6)) = ((2 * ((3√)(x^6)*(x^2)) * y^2) / (2 * x * y^3))</li>
<li>((((x^2)<em>(x^2/3)) * y^2) / (x * y^3)) = (((x</em>(x^2/3)) * y^2) / ( y^3))</li>
<li>((x*(x^2/3)) / ( y^1)) = (x*(x^2/3) / y)</li>
<li>(x*(x^2/3) / y) = (x * (3√)x^2 / y)</li>
<li>(x * (3√)x^2 / y)</li>
</ul>
<p>So &quot; (x * (3√)x^2 / y) &quot; is the answer to simplifying it. Canceled things, reformated things, then simplifyed over and over again. You see:</p>
<ul>
<li>y^2 / y^3 = y^(3-2) . . . y^1</li>
<li>y / y = 1</li>
<li>8/3 = Not Whole number</li>
<li>(3√)2^8 = (3√)2^6 * (3√)2^2</li>
<li>2^6 * 2^2 = 2^(6+2) . . . 2^8</li>
<li>(2 * x) / (2 * x) = 1</li>
<li>x * 1 = x</li>
<li>x^1 = x</li>
<li>(3√)y^6 = (y^6)^(1/3) . . . y^(6*1/3) . . . y^2</li>
<li>√y^6 = (y^6)^1/2 . . . y^(6*1/2) . . . y^3</li>
<li>√(4x^2 * y^6) = √4 * √x^2 * √y^6</li>
<li>√4 = 2</li>
<li>√x^2 = x</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, just use formula&#x27;s, techniques, and break them apart to idvidualy simplify. Divide and conquer, defeat by detail, use those pricinpals. Guy from before is smoking and pacing around outside, currently 11:00. Now 11:05, I suppose I should take a break. I&#x27;m just listening to music, should exersice. Currently listening to music &quot;My way&quot;, 11:15. To think, I did all that... For what is a man, what has he got! If not himself!? They he has naught! Amazing song, really.</p>
<p>Gonna exersice 11:20. I like cats, so does my brother. But he&#x27;s lying, he plays games with cats in them. He has like 30 cat plushies sitting around, they are unlucky to be with him. He... never mind. Now 11:25, back to exersice. Currently 11:35, did 50 pushups and washed my hands. I will relax for a bit. Currently 12:15, I do not know what to do. I will work on the MC script, why not, wasting time is a waste of time which could&#x27;ve been saved and used better rather than being wasted like a waste of time.</p>
<p>Currently 12:34, 1 2 3 4, ha. I worked a little on what I would like to discus with the event planners, that way I can work to the best of my and others abilities. Now 12:45, I am happy with what I&#x27;ve done, I made a list of this to say in discussions prioir to the show.</p>
<p>Currently 1:05, I&#x27;m just wasting time, but relaxing.</p>
<p>Ate lunch, now 1:54.</p>
<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary><p>Ranting about Naruto being realisticly unrealistic</p></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>I was watching Naruto, I love it, only problem is how 50% of it makes no sense. But that&#x27;s how plots are, they&#x27;re scripted, but I dislike sakura. She is always mean to naruto, and is kinda... yeah mean to naruto. Tsunade&#x27;s character is so dislikable, she is a terrible hokage, even the other kage mentioned this. She is obnoxious and too loud, but I suppose that&#x27;s just how her character was made? It&#x27;s annoying how they bring down Ino and make sakura look better. In fact they always portrey sakura as such, but I&#x27;m intrested in naruto, who the show is about. I also love the sasuke arcs, they are always full of bombs of knowledge and super cool. Itachi was a great man, but a terrible family memmber. Sasuke gets all the girls, and they are always polite to him, thats cool. Naruto is always portreyed as dumb, by Sakura who non-stop calls him an idiot. I just want to see battles, lore, naruto getting stronger, sasuke getting stronger, and also to see naruto become hokage. I have little to no intrest for the sidecharacters, that are annoying. To be honest 90% of the side characters of cool, but the enemy side charcters can also be cool. Sometimes things feel forced in naruto, like always trying to make sakura and tsunade &quot;strong&quot; looking. I do not care, stop, go back to naruto. I don&#x27;t need to see sakura punching a tree, only to have that tree fly to mars. I need to see naruto doing quests, missions, and battling. Naruto is cool, so stop making sakura call him an idiot every damn time she speaks, it is not good. But anyways, what do I care, I&#x27;m not the one making the show.</p><p>I do think however they intended to show sakura as annoying and tsunade as unreliable and a bad hokage, maybe to show that naruto is mature for handling them? Who cares, if you like sakura, good for you. I want naruto to be happy, being with sakura is clearly a bad option, no wonder sasuke rejected her. Sakura is not a tomboy, she&#x27;s just rude, mainly to naruto. Also, naruto is as strong as kakashi (as mentioned), and kakashi is very strong. So then how are the other characters fighting these powerful enemies? They arent, it&#x27;s mostly naruto. Shikimaru is smart, so if he lacks strength, he can make up for it in smarts. Sakura, is a random chunin in a vast village/kingdom called the leaf village, so why is she so strong? And why did they make her a main side character? Now-a-days in naruto, lee is portreyed as dumb and &quot;works out too much&quot; by ten ten. She also is being like sakura, always saying lee is a workout addict, and calling him an idiot. Lee was smart, why make his character dumb?! I like seeing lee on screen, his story is inspiring, damn.</p></div></div></details>
<p>Anyways, currently 2:15, nothing like complaining about things beyond your control. I like the show Naruto, these are just some things that bug me and happen too frequently. I&#x27;ll study for now. Some guy outside my window is staring into someones house, like bro? What are you up to? Just in the middle of the sidewalk just peering into someones house?</p>
<p>NONONO, he is looking at the solar eclipse!!! I FORGOT, TODAY AT 2:00!! I should be outside!!!! Damn, can I go? Most likely, but I have to ask.</p>
<p>Alright! Currently 3:48, I saw the entire eclipse, it was cool. I looked at the sun, it didn&#x27;t hurt, till ten seconds later. I was with my family, they came after 50% of it was done though, they ahd work. I just hung around outside chucking rocks at lamposts and coffe cups. I saw this big group of people, a family, one kid who went to my school was in there. I went up to them and asked him if he is in my school. He said yes in broken english, I then asked what highschool he&#x27;ll be going to, he responed &quot;east wood&quot;. It is a highschool known for having many gay students, the is reputedly by me. I heard from several schoolmates about it. I responed with, &quot;huron&quot;, he then acknoledged me by saying &quot;oh huron&quot;. I am happy, I was not scared to talk to a big group of strangers. I need practice talking to people before the concert (im the emcee btw).</p>
<p>Sooo... What now? I suppose I should exersice? Nah, I&#x27;ll relax for a bit first. Currently 4:00, now 4:30, just wasted time for fun. I&#x27;m not gonna spend any time with my family, <em>sigh</em>. Back to work. Why do I feel like this? . . . No point thinking on it, it&#x27;s obvious. Back to work, yup. Currently 4:44, just kinda sitting. Currently 5:00, studying.</p>
<ul>
<li>1/3 = 3^-1</li>
<li>1/4 = 4^-1</li>
<li>1/6 = 6^-1</li>
<li>2/18 = 2(18^-1)</li>
<li>3/4 = 3(4^-1)</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>You see? This is how it is. So what about:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1/4)^-2 = (4^-1)^-2 . . . 4^(-1*-2) . . . 4^2 . . . 16</li>
<li>So just think 4*4 = 16</li>
<li>(1/7)^-3 = (7^-1)^-3 . . . 7^(-1*-3) . . . 7^3 . . . 343</li>
<li>Think of it like 7<em>7</em>7 = 343</li>
</ul>
<p>Shortcuts are important, but understand is even more important.</p>
<p>Well, currently 6:30, played games, wasted time, then did 50 pushups. I regret it, I just don&#x27;t need to be dumb.</p>
<ul>
<li>2^3 = 2<em>2</em>2 . . . 8</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on.</p>
<ul>
<li>If 2x-3y = 2 then what is 9^x / 27^y = ?</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it is asking us an if then questions, so using the data, lets first simplify.</p>
<ul>
<li>9^x / 27^y = (3^2)^x / (3^3)^y . . . 3^(2x) / 3^(3y) . . . 3^(2x-3y)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we know that &quot;2x-3y=2&quot; so lets plug that in.</p>
<ul>
<li>3^(2x-3y) . . . 3^2 . . . 9</li>
</ul>
<p>Nine is the answer, I&#x27;ll make it more complex next time.</p>
<ul>
<li>8^x = (3√)8</li>
<li>So what is x?</li>
</ul>
<p>We know based on previous data, that the &quot; √ &quot; and &quot; ^ &quot; are very close. Just like addition and substraction.</p>
<ul>
<li>8^1/3 = (3√)8</li>
<li>Thus x = 1/3</li>
</ul>
<p>Easy! Moving on.</p>
<ul>
<li>4^x * y^x = 40^x</li>
<li>So what is x?</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, I&#x27;m not sure.</p>
<ul>
<li>4^x * 10^x = 40^x</li>
<li>4^2 * 10^2 = 40^2 . . . 16 * 100 or 1600</li>
</ul>
<p>Yup checks out, this is correct.</p>
<ul>
<li>3/2 * 5/6</li>
</ul>
<p>What does 3 times? Five, and what does two times? Six, they don&#x27;t move.</p>
<ul>
<li>3/2 / 5/6 . . . 3/2 * 6/5</li>
</ul>
<p>Now what does 3 times? Six, and what does two times? Five, damn why can&#x27;t I understand that.</p>
<ul>
<li>3^0 = 1</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember!! And 1/2^-2 = 4!! Cus 2*2 = 4!!</p>
<ul>
<li>4^x = (4√)4^3 . . . 4^(3/4)</li>
<li>x = 3/4</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, anyways.</p>
<ul>
<li>(4^2)^2 = 4^(2*2)</li>
</ul>
<p>Dang it, I keep forgeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>x^2 * x^-2 = x^(2+(-2) . . . x^0 . . . 1</li>
</ul>
<p>Wait wait.</p>
<ul>
<li>-1-1 = 1+1</li>
</ul>
<p>No, this is bull, so then how come.</p>
<ul>
<li>-x-4 = x + 4</li>
<li>-2-4 = 2+4 ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah this does not work. Currently 7:50, just gonna relax for now.</p>
<p>_Forgot what I did, I think I watched TV, then ate dinner. Afterwards I did my math homework, then slept.</p>

<p>My birthday is in three days, anyways.</p>
<p>Got back from school, we are starting our Track-And-Field unit. Just relised, more than half a year has passed since I came to canada. I feel alarm, dread, and forboding at the same time. I shall invent a new word for what I&#x27;m feeling, I feel like I&#x27;m sinking.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fontic; The feeling of sinking, dread, alarm, and relization. Coupeled with woe, and a possible future of dolor. &quot;You&#x27;ve made a mistake, you didn&#x27;t do something right, you forgot.&quot; Your doomed, you&#x27;ve wasted this time of your life. I&#x27;ve messed, dang it, this is a possible crack in my future.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, &quot; Fontic &quot;, just made the term up, it is from &quot;Fontinkos&quot; in greek. I choose it because, might as well. I also thought of &quot;volic&quot;, but I couldn&#x27;t decide between the two. I&#x27;ll just do something now.</p>
<p>Currently 7:30, where has my day gone?</p>
<p>Excuses and crisis, as flames erupt, nary but few know of such tough luck. The folly of a child, but small, where is this, if not fall? Hence why, in the name of excuses has such crisis erupts, as unity exists only as the shadow of obliteration. By and by as the days go by, my mind as a fortress gets rocked all freyyed. But alas, I&#x27;m fine, as I&#x27;m happy my walls still shine. But deep down, as the caslte of my emotions subsides, I look above nothing is in sight. Why, I have emotions, but these emotion lack meaning behind the streams, gone were they there. I, as a being of sanity, can only be an intrument of emotions naught of general dismay. But why, as of late, does my emotions decieve me. But it does not indeed hurt.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m joking, I just wanted to try writing poems.</p>
<p><em>Next day, ate dinner, then slept.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-10th-">April 10th 😄<a href="#april-10th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 10th 😄" title="Direct link to April 10th 😄">​</a></h3>
<p>Last night, I got okay sleep. The nighbors were partying so loud they&#x27;re laughs and jokes could be heard from inside the rooms. People can be so inconsiderate, but I don&#x27;t really mind, as the laughter isn&#x27;t bad. I slept after they stopped, then woke up. I brushed then wrote this down.</p>
<p>Currently 7:45, not sure what to do. I guess I&#x27;ll work on french homework, it&#x27;s tedious, and I&#x27;m not into french. But I have to do it, it&#x27;s not a bad class either. If I was intrested to learn french, then I would love that class, because the teacher teaches us concepts and stuff very effeiciently. Though, I&#x27;m not intrested in french, as I&#x27;m taking spanish in highschool.</p>
<p>Today is a sunny day, it&#x27;s nice outside, I&#x27;ll play soccer with my friends. Should be fun, but now it&#x27;s 9:44. I ate breakfeast and finished my french homework. I&#x27;ll study or something. Currently 10:06, have not studied, I just don&#x27;t feel like it. I&#x27;ll let my computer charge, then I&#x27;ll study. Currently 11:00, things that hurt, why? Frankly, I make bad choices, 1 hour of my life, gone. I learned my lesson, but I need to be better. I feel like bad, dang it. It&#x27;s disgusting, the feeling I feel, I brought it upon myself though. To no avail, have I veiled my stupidity. To be better, is naturally commonplace, but such words mean naught in the face of insanity. Momentary or not, clouded, yet sane. Why, do I make such choices?</p>
<p>For what is a man, what has he got? He has himself, or naught. I&#x27;ve decided, learned, experianced, wasted years making dumb decisions. I have to change, wasting time won&#x27;t help me, but words as this change naught but my momentary self. I, in the future, am a great man. But I in the present have much to learn, too much, too little time. But time is how you view it, I need to slow down, as I do not exist outside my own thoughts, no one else can either. Currently 11:15, I need to get back on the grind. Shameful, silly, stupid, actions define us? No, it&#x27;s what we do about them, I am sane (so why?). Whatever, back to work. Maybe I&#x27;m just growing up, slow/fast as it may be. This feeling in my throat pains me, I&#x27;m choking, pain helps us grow. But what if the things that should induce pain, do not? Then do we not grow from such enounters, I know it has no effect on me as I do not grow from painless things. I grow from pain, from happiness, so why? Why do I not feel fonitc? I&#x27;m gonna be fourteen soon, I need to be... 14.</p>
<ul>
<li>I can&#x27;t do it, I don&#x27;t wanna study, I will exersice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently 7:30, how did we get here? So I ate lunch at 12:23, it was tasty. I finished at 1:30-ish, then went out to play soccer with ym younger brother till 2:00. I then walked to my friends house, met up with another friend, then walked to another friends house. One friend said he can&#x27;t go because he was playing fortnite, like, hop off fortnite. I got to the soccer field at 3:00, it was my upcoming highschool&#x27;s field, I played till 5:00. Then walked home, got back around 5:30. After than I did duolingo till 7:27-ish. I also did duolingo 11:30-12:30. O my gosh, duolingo is so fun, it is a video games, that helps you learn. I spent 3 hours on it today, I learned so much, it&#x27;s crazy. They make you wanna learn by doing XP, GEMS, LEVLES, TEIRS, etc. It&#x27;s facinating, and honestly I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</p>
<p>Currently 8:05, I did 100 pushups then washed my hands and face. I&#x27;m just relaxing now. Currently 8:25, I&#x27;m hungry. I&#x27;ll check what I have to do for tomorrow, then relax some more. Just checked, and relised, I haven&#x27;t read in a while. I&#x27;ll spend some time reading, I&#x27;m happy.</p>
<p>Currently 10:00, I ate dinner after reading for like 20 or so minutes. I&#x27;ll brush now, yeah.</p>

<p>I did some stuff, and some duolingo. Prepared for my birthday tomorrow.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-12th-">April 12th 🥳<a href="#april-12th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 12th 🥳" title="Direct link to April 12th 🥳">​</a></h3>
<p>My birthday!! I&#x27;m writing this on the 13th, but I gave out five bags of fancy chocolate caremel candies, cause why not give back on your birthday. I then spent some time with my family, cut the chocolate cake. Then went to Toys&#x27;R&#x27;Us, amazing. I didn&#x27;t want to go to it though, but once I got there it had so many things. I bought 2 (big) toy cars and 4 board games. Deluxe chinese chackers, classic checkers, and small connect four. The deluxe chinese checkers  were on sale, so they were the same price as the classic checkers. Both the checkers came with a solid wooden board, good quality, and big too. I got a small connect four because, it was cheap. Meaning, that I could get small Monopoly too. Rather than one big board game, I got 2 smaller ones.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the end of the day by going out to eat with my family, we are trying to go out more often. I wen&#x27;t to Harvey&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve got to say, it tops almost every place I&#x27;ve been too. The outside looks boring, but the inside is phenomenal, and the food... Amazing, the quantity, price, everything. The poutine was great (super cheasy), I&#x27;m happy.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-13th-">April 13th 🎉<a href="#april-13th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 13th 🎉" title="Direct link to April 13th 🎉">​</a></h3>
<p>Did some duolingo, I spend hours on it everyday (it helps if you practice). I ate some leftover cake, then some leftover food from harvey&#x27;s, the quantity was a lot. I enjoyed it, then we went to a bakery, the bread was quite delicious. I never go to sa bakery, so I (decided) wanted to go to there for my birthday. The bread was well priced, freashly made, we watched it happen. The stores price it more because they need to make a profit, but if you go to a bakery, I think you get better prices. Because most items were from $1 - 5, the bigger breads were $3, and the biggest was $5 something. I enjoyed the bread when I got home.</p>
<p>Currently 2:45 exactly, I haven&#x27;t eaten lunch yet, but I suppose the bread was very filling. I&#x27;m just writing here, oh I also did duolingo. I am trying to learn spanish and hindi. I grind on it, because there is an xp and gems system. I am: &quot;Shaurya, Level-99&quot;. It&#x27;s very easy to get xp, just spent loads of time on high xp lessons. They make the more tedious ones have more xp gains to promote &quot;practice makes perfect&quot;. I don&#x27;t mind, cause it helps.</p>
<p>Anyways, I signed up summer school on the 11th. It&#x27;ll be from 8:30 to 3:00-ish. July 2nd to July 26th, 24 days.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tu hables espanol?</li>
<li>Yo soy &quot;cool&quot;, tu?</li>
<li>Yo hablo ingles, mi &quot;dad&quot; hables.</li>
<li>Yo como pan, tu comes pan, el come pan. Tu hablo?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, anyways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Je suis &quot;cool&quot;.</li>
<li>Tu, est-ce-que tu manger pain?</li>
<li>Ne donner pas &quot;$0&quot;, je vouloir &quot;$1&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>My french is bad, I had to look up most of these. I have been studying french for months now, but haven&#x27;t got anywhere, I have no intrest either.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ni hao, wo de nam shir &quot;suo-li&quot;, tu shir shei?</li>
<li>Ni de shui, bu how.</li>
<li>Yi, are, san, si, u, liu, chi, ba, zho, san.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#x27;t know how accurate this is, as I&#x27;ve studied chinese for only 5 years. I&#x27;m intrested, not anymore. I went to a chinese immersian school, for 5 years, but forgot everything.</p>
<ul>
<li>Toum kessa ho? Toum chei-ye bread?</li>
<li>Mera hindi both katernac he.</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand hindi to the tee, but am bad at talking. I&#x27;m learning how to read, but it is absuredly hard. I knwo orea and hindi, I mix the two a lot. They sound almost the same.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mo</li>
<li>Me</li>
</ul>
<p>But that&#x27;s beside the point, I know english too, obviously. I&#x27;m not english, but learnt from talking to people (and school work). I know 6 languages!!! Well not really, I&#x27;ve studied 6 languages, I just know 1 properly. I can read and write in english, not hindi, spanish, french, chinese, or orea.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&#x27;ll do something now 3:03. Everyone around me enjoys wasting time, why is this such, their minds are clouded but isnt mine too?</p>
<p>Anyways, after wasting some time. Was it relaxing, no. I&#x27;m not relaxed, if anything I wan&#x27;t to do more? No, something&#x27;s wrong, I feel like wasting more time. Was it fun, no. So then why? I dunno, but I&#x27;m gonna not waste time.</p>
<p>Alright! SOOO, 8:08, I&#x27;ve wasted some time, I mean I played with my brother checkers, but then wasted a long time. I came to my room to study, but just wasted time, damn. I caught myself mindlessly scrolling, and an hour of my day gone. That&#x27;s crazy, genuinly.</p>
<ul>
<li>x^2 + x^2 = 2x^2</li>
<li>(6x) + (-x) = 5x</li>
<li>(6x) - (-x) = 7x</li>
<li>x^2 + (-x^2) = 0</li>
</ul>
<p>Random, moving on. FOIL, First, out, inside, last</p>
<ul>
<li>2 * (3+5) = 2(3) + 2(5) . . . 6 + 10 . . . 16 . . or . .  2 * 8</li>
<li>(2 + 3)(4 + 5) = (2*4) + (2*5) + (3*4) + (3*5) . . . 8+10+12+15 . . . 20 + 25 . . . 45</li>
<li>(2 + 3)(4 + 5) = 4(2 + 3) + 5(2 + 3) . . . (8+12) + (10+15) . . . 20+25 . . . 45</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, this checks out, good method if you need it. Currently 8:30, glad I had some time to do at least 30 minutes of studying.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2x - 5)(3x + 3) = 3x(2x - 5) + 3(2x - 5) . . . (6x^2 - 15x) + (6x - 15) . . . 6x^2 - 9x - 15</li>
<li>15 - 6 = 9</li>
<li>x * x = x^2</li>
<li>2x * 2 = 2x + 2x . . . 4x</li>
<li>2x * 2x = 4x^2</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, well this is cool. It looks funky, but it works, and in common knowledge.</p>

<p>Currently 4:36, I wrote about april 14th. I&#x27;m starting to write less because I&#x27;m doing more in real life.</p>
<p>I will do something now.</p>
<p>Currently 10:15 at night. I did do something, I relaxed, studied, then played soccer with my friends from 6 to 7:48. I then relaxed then ate dinner, I&#x27;m relaxing again after cleaning my room. I&#x27;ll go brush, it&#x27;s fun doing things. Currently 10:36, my brother beat me at connect 4, he never does that. Is he smart? No he&#x27;s still dumb, he makes the simplest mistakes, must&#x27;ve been luck. Gonna brush now, yeah.</p>
<p><em>Next day, slept.</em></p>

<p>Gonna go to school now, 8:20.</p>
<p>Currently 7:13 in the evening. I went to school, came back, played basketball. Then walked home, I then called my friend, he showed me fortnite for an hour and a half. We also worked on a school prject. I then studied a little, then ate, then now I&#x27;m trying to study after just wasting time. I&#x27;ve got a math test in two days, so I should study.</p>
<ul>
<li>x + 2 = x + 2</li>
<li>x + x + x^2 = 2x + x^2</li>
<li>2x^2 + x^2 = 3x^2</li>
<li>2x^2 * x = 2x * x^2 . . or . . 2x^(2+1) . . . 2x^3</li>
</ul>
<p>Some notes. Currently 8:12, I studied with my dad for a bit, funny it&#x27;s been exactly 1 hour. I just did some ratios and rates, it was very simple, and easy. Becuase there are formulas for everything, but common sense should be the most well known formula of them all. Gonna relax now.</p>
<p><em>Next day, slept after doing some art homework till 11:00.</em></p>

<p>Back from school, 4:41, I just had my feildtrip. It was fun, we listened to people go up and present. I was the one chosen to go up and thank the speaker, (because my teacher trusts me). The presentation/speach was in front of many different schools, in which I only knew my own. There were about a 1000 students, I stood in front of like 250, because there were 4 rooms, and a 1000 kids from different schools. The first man Rick, one of canada&#x27;s most wanted told us about his life story. About how he was in a normal house, but then gut drugged and hence forth became addicted. He then persued heroin and robbed drug dealers, this caused him to go to prison after being part of a biker&#x27;s gang. He&#x27;s been shot many time, stabbed, raped, and has been in gang fights. This man told us to learn from his past and make our futures better. I thanked him and then went back to my seat, I was nervous, but said it properly. Why was I nervous, I didn&#x27;t know any of them. Becuase in my mind it wasn&#x27;t about them, it was about me, I wanted to execute it well, however I was tasked with making a thank you with no info and no practice. So I was nervous, but still I should be calm.</p>
<p>Currently 5:20, I ate some things, what now? I suppose I could exersice, and do duolingo.</p>
<p><em>Next day, I did do exactly that, then studied for a little. Then ate and slept.</em></p>

<p>I had my math test today, it wasn&#x27;t very hard. I will get my score later in the week, I think I did good. The questions were not very hard, but I&#x27;m just saying this because I&#x27;m confident I got most of it right. Imagine I get like a 80%, dang. I will study noq, haven&#x27;t properly done that in a while. So while I was walking home, I saw a friend who plays basketball, I stopped by and played with three friends for about an hour and a half. I also should continue studying biology, physics, and chem.</p>
<ul>
<li>Just had my mind blown</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>(2x^3 - 5x) + 3x^2 + 2(4)</li>
<li>Make into a quadratic equation</li>
</ul>
<p>The question here, asks us to make it into a quadratic equation. Meaning &quot; ax^2 + bx + c = 0 &quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>(2x^3 - 5x) + 3x^2 + 2(4) . . . x(2^3 - 5) + 3x^2 + 8</li>
</ul>
<p>I reformated it because x is mutiplied in both cases, so another way to write it is that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because: 6 = 6(1)</li>
<li>4x . . .  x(2+2) . . .  2(4/2)x . . .  x * (2 * 2) . . .  6x - 2x</li>
<li>(15x-2x) . . . x(15-2) . . . x(13) . . . 13x</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways to represent things, doing so makes life easier, or harder.</p>
<ul>
<li>x(2^3 - 5) + 3x^2 + 8 . . . x(8 - 5) + 3x^2 + 8 . . . x(3) + 3x^2 + 8</li>
<li>x(3) + 3x^2 + 8 . . . 3x + 3x^2 + 8 . . . 3x^2 + 3x + 8</li>
</ul>
<p>I continued to simplify and reformat, this led to it being a quadratic equation. Currently 8:15, today passed by quick? No, I just spent it really fast. Studying goes by slowly, but wasting time goes by lightning fast? No, it&#x27;s all the same, and studying goes by fast too. If you are engaged anything will pass fast. The more you focus on leaving, the more you&#x27;ll pay attention to not leaving.</p>
<ul>
<li>Turns out, I was wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>So yeah, I got my khanacademy question wrong, of course it is different from the question I made up.</p>
<ul>
<li>5x = 5y</li>
<li>So:</li>
<li>x = y</li>
</ul>
<p>And.</p>
<ul>
<li>6/12 = 3*2 / 3*4 . . . <del>3</del>*2 / <del>3</del>*4 . . . 2/4 . . . 1/2</li>
</ul>
<p>I crossed out the 3 / 3 because it just equals to one.</p>
<p><em>Two days later, I slept.</em></p>

<p>I went to school, had fun. I did shockput in phys-ed, my teacher said I was really good at it. She also told the other teacher I was good, maybe I should try out shockput.</p>
<p><em>Next day, went shopping for clothes to wear to the concert (as I&#x27;m the master of ceimonies I need to be dressed good) slept. I bought really nice clothes, one calven klein shirt, and a nice suit pant. The quality of the shirt was stunning, I was (am) very happy with it.</em></p>

<p>Woke up feeling sick, went out to buy new shoe, my old ones have holes, the shoe is falling apart. The top of my shoe fell off, the sides are torn, it looks like it went through a hurricane. I had &quot; Fila A-High Triple Black Sneakers Mens Faux Leather High Top Shoes &quot;. They were size US 13, and served me well, I really enjoyed those shoes, I won&#x27;t forget them. I bought 2 big black sketcher shoes, the &quot; Skechers Work Relaxed Fit: Nampa Wyola Slip Resistant 13&#x27;s &quot;, and a running shoe.</p>
<p>Currently 4:20, I do not know what I&#x27;m doing, I wasted time, relaxed. And am now studying biology, which I haven&#x27;t done in a while, but quickly jogged my memory.</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot obtain usable carbon from breathing, you can eat to gain it though, grass is a good source.</li>
<li>You cannot obtain usable carbon from rolling around in dirt, only food.</li>
<li>How does anything create anything? By rearanging atoms, molecules, and resources to make new ones.</li>
<li>Glucose molecules do not contain nitrogen.</li>
<li>To form things, eat things so that you have things that you can rearange to make new things.</li>
<li>If I was a worm, how would I get carbon? By eating.</li>
<li>To create, costs energy, consumption.</li>
<li>Breaking = Releasing energy</li>
<li>Creating = Consuming energy</li>
<li>Metabolic pathways that build/create, consume not release.</li>
<li>Metabolic pathways that destroy/break, release not consume.</li>
<li>To break molecules down into smaller parts/simpler parts releases energy.</li>
<li>&quot;In metabolic pathway, the product of chemical reactions become the reactant of the next reaction.&quot; This is what khan acedemy said, but how? Is it 1+1 = 2, so then 2 = 1+1 = 2? And the reactions sparks some chemical rearanging of atoms??? I do not know.</li>
<li>The metabolic pathways rearange, they dont create atoms, I thought they did at first.</li>
<li>The reactions are not catalyzed (caused) by just one enzyme, they are each caused by (1 or more possibly in a set) unique enzymes.</li>
<li>Atoms are not made or destroyed in metabolic pathways</li>
<li>Nucleotides can be combined to form larger complex molecules (they are small molecules).</li>
<li>Glucose and alanine? Some of glucose is used to make/become alanine.</li>
<li>Macromolecules, you break them down to make other things. These are carbohydrates and stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently 5:20, been at this for an hour. Gonna take a break, yeah. Currently 5:48, wasted about 5 minutes, then started studying on this website called &quot;brilliant&quot;. It seems like duolingo, but for studies. It isnt bad, rather, it is great, but I feel like only is worth it if you buy premiuim.</p>
<p>Anyways, currently 6:26, I studied a little (basic algebra) then exersiced. I will now relax for some time.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sky is blue, because I see it is blue.</li>
<li><em>What if you see wrong?</em></li>
<li>But the sky is blue.</li>
<li><em>This does not prove anything.</em></li>
<li>But I see it is blue.</li>
<li><em>You could have seen wrong.</em></li>
<li>But.. But it is indeed blue!</li>
<li><em>But how can you be so sure?</em></li>
<li>. . . I cannot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, I just randomly wrote this. If a then b, but if not b, therfore not a. Modus tollens, the denial of theory by theory. And modes ponenes, the theory of validity on a belief based on if then.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am a being, because I can think, touch, and feel my existence?</li>
<li><em>What is a being?</em></li>
<li>A being is I, as I am a being.</li>
<li><em>But what of it?</em></li>
<li>Can you not see, as you, yourself are a being?</li>
<li><em>No, I could be matter adrift in what place we are in, be it space, existence, or the universe.</em></li>
<li>We are indeed matter, but what does that matter? Matter can become beings.</li>
<li><em>You are correct, but what if you&#x27;re wrong?</em></li>
<li>I am not, since you are matter, and therfore you have the possibility to have being.</li>
<li><em>. . . I am a being? I don&#x27;t know where I am though? What is this plane of existence, where are we?</em></li>
<li>That does not matter... Why it does not matter I know not, but I think, therfore I am.</li>
<li><em>Forcibly projectiing that existence does not matter, matters in itself.</em></li>
<li>But why? Why does that matter?</li>
<li><em>Because you claim to be a being, thus where is your being? As it exists, it has to exist in a place.</em></li>
<li>Am I wrong? I cannot be, I am a being, made of matter, born of existence.</li>
<li><em>Then I cannot tell you, as my being exists outside my understanding. Where does my understanding end?</em></li>
<li>I have no answer, you have no answer. So if not a being, then we are not existing.</li>
<li><em>No we exist, just as beings we exist.</em></li>
<li>You say prior we are not being, so what are you saying now?</li>
<li><em>I was wrong, we are beings, just being one matters.</em></li>
<li>I agree, I was also wrong, as we are matter, and we beings are matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently 9:30, I wrote this prior to dinner, I had a discussion in my head, and wrote it down. Afterwards I had dinner, this really makes me think. Are we beings, or does being one even matter? I haven&#x27;t the answer that perfectly answers it, but I can we say we matter, as we are beings. Anyways, I will relax then sleep.</p>
<p>&quot; Nothing truly is, everything is becoming. &quot;</p>
<p>This is amazing, it was said by Heraclitus about how nothing is what it is, as it is always changing and in flux. While it is itself, it is also not intself as it cannot be the same after becoming what it isnt. You know, as I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, it&#x27;s like code, us. The universe, it&#x27;s all information, but why? You light a match, and it burns to dust, is it still the match? No, it went through a change, which untimatly made it become somethign different. Information, code, and everything from our universe was applied in our thinking. Where did we get code from? From nature, but if thats the case, where did nature get code from. Us? As we are the universe, it would be safe to say we are code, but no we arent. Anyways, this is getting out hand, if I was actually a sceptic, I would act like it (by being weird as heck about &quot;omg this plant is not real?!!1!?1!&quot; ). But anyways, time to relax.</p>
<p>What is this is a simulation? And then we make a simulation, would there be endless layers of simulations? Like a game, do the characters know they are characters? And this seems not very plausable, maybe because I cannot find it such. To be honest, even if we were in a simulations, the feeling/simulated feel of hunger would still be &quot;real&quot; to us, and the happiness/satisfaction of eating would also be &quot;real&quot;. As simulated pain, is pain to a simulated being. As real pain is pain in and of itself to a &quot;real&quot; being. But what is real? I&#x27;ll figure that out eventually.</p>
<p><em>Next day, I ate bread chicken and beans, then slept.</em></p>

<p>I woke up, then did some things. Currently 12:27, I have time till my day ends. I ate waffles for breakfeast, they were phenomenal paired with whipped cream ans bannans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy waffles</li>
<li>Buy whipped cream</li>
<li>Buy bannanas</li>
<li>Cook waffles</li>
<li>Put waffles on plate</li>
<li>Open whipped cream bottle</li>
<li>Open bannana</li>
<li>Slice banana sideways into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
<li>Place 3 bannana slices onto each waffle</li>
<li>Spray the whipped cream onto the waffle</li>
<li>Stare at the finished product for 10 seconds</li>
<li>Pick up the waffle carefully</li>
<li>Open mouth some-what wide (minimum 1 1/2 inch)</li>
<li>Move finished product into mouth slowly</li>
<li>Close mouth down some-what softly (minimum 40-60 PSI for enjoyment)</li>
<li>Let the piece you bit off slide down to your tongue</li>
<li>Use tongue to shift the piece towards teeth (preferably the ones in the sides, not canine)</li>
<li>Chew at around 50-70 psi for maximum flavor to speed ratio</li>
<li>Take 5 seconds before swallowing to really taste whats in your mouth</li>
<li>Use tongue to shift food in the center of mouth</li>
<li>Use tongue to push food towards the throat area</li>
<li>Swallow semi-slowly</li>
<li>If waffle is still in hand, Repeat steps 13 through 23 till waffle = eaten</li>
<li>If waffle not in hand, repeat step 12, then repeat steps 13 through 23 till waffle = eaten</li>
<li>When waffle = eaten, end.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, this was very random, but I guess I just went for it and wrote down some steps on something I ate in the morning. Currently 12:40, took like 10 minutes to write, wow. I&#x27;ll study now I guess.</p>
<ul>
<li>Carbon can be used to form DNA</li>
<li>More energy is released when bonds are made, than when there are broken</li>
<li>Plants make oxygen</li>
<li>ATP, used as energy</li>
<li>Molecules can be combined to form larger molecules</li>
<li>In non-light scenarios, they use non-organic carbon (but fix it using atp and nadph) <em>I think</em></li>
<li>You do not use macromolecules directly, you need to break them down to combine them</li>
<li>Proteins and DNA can be made from the parts of carbon, rearanged</li>
<li>ATP &amp; NADPH on top.</li>
<li>Cellular resperation, ATP can be used as energy</li>
<li>Not entirely true: Glucose * 113 = starch</li>
<li>Diploid = 2</li>
<li>Haploid = 1</li>
<li>The energy released in formation is less than the cost of breaking.</li>
<li>More resources = more carry</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, currently 3:20, my friend called and asked if I wanted to play soccer, I said yes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Logistic, eventually stops. It is a finite exponential.</li>
<li>Exponential, the growth infinitly exponentially increaes, as it is an infinite exponential growth.</li>

<p>I went to school, wore my new shoes. The running ones, they fit good, and feel amazing. I think they give an extra inch or two of height, its nice.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m just studying biology now.</p>
<ul>
<li>The more options that consumers have in a ecosystem, the more likely they&#x27;ll survive a disturbance (such as a food source leaving)</li>
<li>Species richness, the more diverse it is</li>
<li>Use common sense when asked, &quot;Less rain, means less reasources&quot;, this is true.</li>
<li>Receliance is ecosystems is due to how fast a system can recover/get back to normal/original</li>
<li>Invasive species outcompete the ecosystem for food/resources</li>
<li>The more species, the more ecosystem stability and complexity</li>
</ul>
<p>My friends today, asked me if I knew the &quot;lexi bonner&quot; situation. I said no, but today, on my for you page in youtube it showed &quot;explanation about the distubing lexi bonner situation&quot;. I must say, that&#x27;s messed it. A 12-14 year old girl (my age), assaulted a 8 year old, and killed him by repeated injuries (like kicking). She was like 13, and all her friends were recording her kill a little kid. Why did no one help the kid? He was defensless, if he was the same age, he would&#x27;ve easily killed her (but she really fought an 8 year old). That is someones son, someones joy, and she killed him. He wanted to be friends, and she went ahead and (yknow). How does no one know her real name? Adress? School? I don&#x27;t think any consequences have happened, not even police. Is it because shes a minor? Put her in juvie, till shes 40, then she wont get a job, or anything. I don&#x27;t understand, that&#x27;s someones family, and... Just why? If I hope she dies, that would curse me. I know she&#x27;ll get karma, but how? We kill bugs and ants everyday, they are alive too. So what is justice? It&#x27;s whatever we think is right, what is right? That doesn&#x27;t matter, what is wrong matters. Killing with no reason, and that too someone much much weaker than you, hmm. I just, how does things like this happen? There were like 5 people in the video, a guy too, why did they not stop her? Did she enjoy it, why did the kids family not come rushing out (to yknow). How was she able to (yknow) a kid in broad daylight, any neighbors must&#x27;ve seen it? Or did they record too? I don&#x27;t understand, but that little boy could&#x27;ve become a great man in the future, she took his future. She, is not worth thinking about, there is trash everywhere. If only police would clear it up, but they do clean it up. So why has that not happened yet? The family needs to know who (offed) their 8 year old son, their pride and joy stompted on (literly) by a ducking 13 year old girl. Even if she is a girl, she needs to be held accountable. But how, how does no one know her name? OR anything?</p>
<p>It is worth thinking about, since (yknow) can happen. The fact the boys death and pain became a meme is absurd. Police, the neighbors, classmates, people recording need to turn her in for jailtime. The people there will teach her about messing with kids, why a kid? Because your so weak you can only fight a man half your age and height. But to be honest, it happened, as angry as it is, I cannot do anything. So to care when uninvoled would be, good and bad. Since the only thing I can do is hope she&#x27;d be caught soon. If nothing I can do, nothing I can contribute, nothing should I bring upon myself. Back to work. If others can&#x27;t be good human being, then I can, and I will try. This generation, my generation, is being led wrong, we need more punishment. We need bullying (for bullies, bad people, and others) to come back, words alone won&#x27;t solve world hunger, neither will words solve war. A handshake and a eye-to-eye contact with words of gratitude and peace might, but not always. If you can be better, be. To be, if possible, be. To be or not to be, if possible be.</p>

<p>Currently 7:30, I dont know. I studied, wasted time, did some stuff. Then decided to make voice deeper.</p>
<p>Verse 1:</p>
<p>In the stillness of the night, my mind takes flight</p>
<p>Thoughts and visions dance in the moonlight</p>
<p>Dreams of a future so bright, out of sight</p>
<p>Lost in a world where everything feels just right</p>
<p>Chorus:</p>
<p>I&#x27;m a daydream believer, lost in reverie</p>
<p>Chasing after stars and possibilities</p>
<p>In the silence of the night, my soul takes flight</p>
<p>I&#x27;m a daydream believer, dreaming of what could be</p>
<p>Verse 2:</p>
<p>In the depths of my mind, I find a hidden place</p>
<p>Where reality and fantasy embrace</p>
<p>Colors and shapes interlace, leaving a trace</p>
<p>Of a world beyond time and space</p>
<p>Bridge:</p>
<p>I close my eyes and let my spirit soar</p>
<p>Into a realm where dreams are the core</p>
<p>Where the impossible becomes possible</p>
<p>And my heart feels truly unstoppable</p>
<p>Chorus:</p>
<p>I&#x27;m a daydream believer, lost in reverie</p>
<p>Chasing after stars and possibilities</p>
<p>In the silence of the night, my soul takes flight</p>
<p>I&#x27;m a daydream believer, dreaming of what could be</p>
<p>Outro:</p>
<p>As the night fades into day, my dreams will stay</p>
<p>Carrying me through the ups and downs of life&#x27;s highway</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll keep on dreaming, come what may</p>
<p>A daydream believer, forever and a day.</p>

<p>I had my test, it is half of my grade. I got 19/21, not bad. One question I got wrong, the answer was all of the above. The other one was a spesific date, I had a 50-50 chance (true or false) and got it wrong.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is my dads birthday, I will prepare for that. Currently 6:00 already, just been wasting time. I will do some homework now, yeah.</p>
<p><em>Next day, I finished my artwork as it is due today. We were tasked with drawing a train, a subway train.</em></p>

<p>My dads birthday, I brought money to school. I had school, walked back with my friends. I bought them some candy, 25 cents per each candy (they were 4 inches long and 2 inches wide). I spent like $5 or more, then bought a Fiji bottle of water (cause it looked cool). After that I bought some food and some drinks, I walked home after parting with my friends. I got back and ate the food, it was deleicious, we cut the cake then played &quot;Cake Bash&quot;, it&#x27;s very fun (not as much as tottaly reliable delivery or rocket league).</p>
<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m just doing things, something. It is 8:40, what now? I guess just hang out with my dad.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-26th">April 26th<a href="#april-26th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 26th" title="Direct link to April 26th">​</a></h3>
<p>I went to school, and got 11.23 seconds for 100 meter run. Then tried again, got 10.13, my hat flew off the first time, so in the second I decided not to wear a hat. I thought it would be a good idea to wear a hat, turns out it wasn&#x27;t (I did not think to tighten it). Anyways, other than that I went to the movie theatre with my parents, we did that in celebration of my dads birthday. We watched the &quot;Kung Fu Panda 4&quot;, it had absolutely stunning graphics, but I&#x27;m dissapointed. As a kid who&#x27;s watched kung fu panda since I was litte (6), I was not satisfyed. The graphics were good, but the content was not... just not it? Know what I mean, it did not live up to my expectations. The story in this movie was garbage, they took idea&#x27;s and decided to make a graphically stunning movie. I know it&#x27;s harsh, but I did not waste 1-2 hours of my life to be dissapointed. It was not epic, nor great. And of course the fox was a girl, and that she... yknow (no spoilers). But lot&#x27;s of movies are doing this, they randomlly create a female character, or use an existing one to: Make the male characters look stupid. Naruto, lee, po, all these different characters and much much more. They use existing girl characters and make them obnoxious, or just &quot;better than the guy&quot;. Why though? I don&#x27;t wanna see po get beaten by some random (no spoilers), I want a legendary adventure! Something I can remeber! Not some sit they just &quot;had to&quot; make. I like the movie, but the plot was nonsense. Po is <em>the</em> dragon warrior, why in THE ABSULOTE hel did you make his character &quot;stupid and dumb&quot;? He was cooler before, just like so many other characters he got changed.</p>
<p>Moving on, I went to watch the band at our school play! They were amazing, like crazy talented. I&#x27;m MC so I have to know what&#x27;s playing in case of any problems. But it was fun to listen to them. Currently exactly 10:10, now 10:11. I will continue studying.</p>
<ul>
<li>(a/b)/c = a/bc</li>
<li>d/(e/f) = d * f/e . . . df/e</li>
</ul>
<p>Just something to write/note down for reference later. Currently 11:15, studied with my dad a little. I&#x27;m learning many new things, it is very cool.</p>
<p>Note: Today, while walking home. The crossing gaurd lady bought me and my friend pizza (2 slices and a drink each). She offered, and we decided to accept. This is not begging, or being cheap and inconsiderate, I will return the favor. If she is giving us pizza (it might be to make herself feel better about yknow helping the world). She is old, and very nice, she is inspiring and kind. The pizza tasted great, my friend felt bad. I told him not to, because when someone buys you something and you feel bad, there was no point of even buying it then. If I hand someone a candy, and they feel bad, then I&#x27;ll either feel bad for offering or feel as if I&#x27;ve wasted my money on someone ungratful or not able to accept a gift. Take the gift, then give back a gift. Him and I aren&#x27;t broke, we have at least $10 in our walets, we can buy the old crossing guard something nice if we pool our money. Do not accept the gift without an intention to appretiate it and give back in turn the same or more gift (like yknow). Do not feel bad, that is being disrespectful to the kindness someone showed you. Just show your appretiation and make them feel good (that was the point of their action). Or if they just wanted to be nice, why? To feel nice about themselves, that or they are just a good human being. So don&#x27;t accept the gift, accept and thank for recieving the gift, appretiate what someone gave you, then give back something in return to show your appretiation. This is how you go about, life. Some may say it as looking cheep or broke, that&#x27;s only if your taking it as charity and not giving something in return/showing your appretiation. Taking something as a free handout is never good, take it as a gift, and resolve yourself on giving back even more to the same person.</p>
<p>I know it may seem counterintuitive, &quot;Take the free hand out?!?!&quot;. NO! Just if they&#x27;re offering and <em><strong>INSISTING</strong></em>, then take it and pay/gift something back in return later. If they say like, &quot;You wanna sit in my chair?&quot; do not say yes! Today I asked my friend if he wanted to sit down, he was standing. He said, &quot;no.. ye.. yeah&quot;. I just sat there quietly then he said, &quot;nah it&#x27;s fine&quot;. I was just asking that out of consideration, I did not actually want to give up my chair, it is my chair (I know I&#x27;m being selfish, but sometimes you just have to be). Usually I always give my chair, but this time I kinda needed the chair as it was the only place for me to sit (you won&#x27;t understand?). Anyways, currently 11:30, spent 15 minutes writing some things in here. Gonna go back to studying? I dunno, I have zero idea what I wanna do. I&#x27;ll study some biology.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mechanism involved in differential gene expression? They regulate how much gene mRNA is broken down before it can start being made into a protien. What does this mean? I do not know, for now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phenotype, what it looks like. Genotype, what it is.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Remember! <em><strong>Go to Madame beringer at 1st period monday!!!</strong></em> For MC rehersal!</p>
<p><em>Next day, slept.</em></p>

<p>I woke up, and played a stratagy game for like 2 hours. Then read, then relaxed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mitosis: (2x+2y) . . . (x+y)(x+y) . . . (x+y) (x+y)</li>
<li>Replication: (x+y) . . . 2(x+y) . . . (2x+2y)</li>
<li>Meiosis: (2x+2y) . . . (2x)(2y) . . . (2x) (2y) . . . (x)(x) (y)(y) . . . (x) (x) (y) (y)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just rough, and meiosis isn&#x27;t exactly like that (at all). Meiosis is like splitting and mixing.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2x)(2y) . . . (x+y)(x+y) . . . 2(1/2x + 1/2y) 2(1/2x + 1/2y) . . . 1/2(x+y) 1/2(x+y) 1/2(x+y) 1/2(x+y)</li>
</ul>
<p>Somewhat? I&#x27;m unsure of how to explain it.</p>
<ul>
<li>1/2x + 1/2y = 1 chromatid</li>
<li>2(1/2x + 1/2y) = 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, I will continue.</p>
<ul>
<li>(3/4x + 1/4y)+(3/4y + 1/4x) = 2</li>
<li>(3/4x + 1/4y)+(y) = 2</li>
<li>(3/4x + 1/4y)+(y) + (3/4y + 1/4x)+(x) = 2x + 2y</li>
<li>2x + 2y = x+x+y+y . . . (1/2x+1/2y)+(1/2x+1/2y) + (1/2x+1/2y)+(1/2x+1/2y)</li>
<li>(1/2x+1/2y)+(1/2x+1/2y) + (1/2x+1/2y)+(1/2x+1/2y) = (3/4x+1/4y)+(1/4x+3/4y) + (1/4x+3/4y)+(3/4x+1/4y)</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you understand? I think I put it simply, each x or y is 1 chromatid (2 chromatids make a chromosome). I think most of the examples I&#x27;ve given are heterozygous or recombanint. Different or combination of the two, yeah.</p>
<p>Currently 3:36, I played games for more hours (polytopia, my favorite game ever). Then ate lunch, did some random things. Then discused about future with my dad. I&#x27;ve decided to make a website about the human body, it intrests me.</p>
<p>Currently 5:36, I went to go shopping for my parents anniversary, it is on monday. I got myself a nice blue t-shirt, it is a royal sky blue color. I will do something now. Currently 7:30, dunno what I was doing, I think I wasted some time. No, I helped my friend write his story (this took like 30 minutes). Then just wasted time till 7:10, and am now eating food. I&#x27;ll create a plan for my website.</p>
<p><em>Next day, did some brainstorming, ate dinner, slept.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-28th">April 28th<a href="#april-28th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 28th" title="Direct link to April 28th">​</a></h3>
<p>Woke up, relaxed, then played polytopia. Then the ate breakfeat, eggs. I then played polytopia for an hour, then video called my friend for some time, he showed me piano. He is the piano player for my schools&#x27;s concert, it is cool, as I&#x27;m the MC. I will study now, currently 11:44.</p>
<ul>
<li>Meiosis, halves the amount of chromosomes in diploid cell. (Ex: 2x . . . x + x . . . x)</li>
<li>2x + 2y = 2 chromosomes</li>
<li>So: x+y = 1 chromosome</li>
<li>X=Y but Y=!X? No, they are just different.</li>
<li>4x / 2 = 2x = 1 chromosome or 2 chromatids</li>
</ul>
<p>SO, if we want to fertalize.</p>
<ul>
<li>(4x) (4y) . . .Meosis. . . (2x) (2y) . . .</li>
<li>Combine two haploid cells to make diploid. . . (x+y+x+y) = 2 chromosome</li>
</ul>
<p>It makes sense, because meosis halves the number, so it becomes haploid, then it combines into a diploid? Then was I wrong yesterday? I dunno, I&#x27;ll check. I was not wrong yesterday, but just showed it kinda badly. I will continue, to study.</p>
<ul>
<li>What affects things? Enviernment, genetics, and more.</li>
<li>Crossing over? When homolougous chromosmes swap/exchange genetic/section info/material in meiosis:</li>
<li>2x + 2y . . . (x+y)+(x+y) . . . I think</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on:</p>
<ul>
<li>CBD, Chronic beryllium disease. The human HLA-DPB1 gene Glu69 variant, causes this when exposed to beryllium. Industrial places have beryllium, a silver-white metal that is used to create things. Inflammed lungs, bad.</li>
<li>Remeber to read the damn question, because I knew the answer I just clicked the wrong correct answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<ul>
<li>DNA MRNA PROTEINS are cool.</li>
<li>Lima bean plants can make hydrogen cyanide in response to bugs chewing on their leaves</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently 2:44, ate lunch, relaxed, then wasted time. I will study for a little.</p>
<ul>
<li>Different environment factors affect the gene expression in plants, which can cause changes to some phenotypes</li>
</ul>
<p>Meaning, that things can change based on the environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, if a flower has lot&#x27;s of bugs pollinating it, it will have agreater chance to have offspring than a flower with less pollination.</li>
<li>Genetic variation, allows to survive better.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like, if a flower is not getting pollinated because of it&#x27;s color, then over time, the flowers will color will change till pollination becomes better. Or more:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you guess a number in someones head, it was luck. There is a 1/10 chance, so if you keep guessing you&#x27;ll eventually get the right answer. How do you know you got the right answer? The person will tell you, &quot;You got it right&quot;. If wrong, &quot;You got it wrong&quot;. In the case of flowers, say green, no bugs come, try again. Then get yellow, all the bugs come, it was a succes. You understand?</li>
</ul>
<p>I could be wrong though.</p>
<ul>
<li>Groups; More likely to survive</li>
<li>Compare the past to determine why the future has come (in genetics)</li>
<li>Ebryoligical; Embryo to fetus stage type?</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently 10:56 at night. Gonna sleep, but before that. I went to a resturant called Pho Sunrise, I loved it, amazing. Before that I relaxed then wasted time, then played polytopia, then studied a little. I then went to the restuant, then came back, then played polytopia, so I am now gonna sleep. I also practiced a bit.</p>

<p>I think I messed up the dates, today is april 29th. What?</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-29th">April 29th<a href="#april-29th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 29th" title="Direct link to April 29th">​</a></h3>
<p>Today, I went to school, it is my parents annivarsary. A girl at school told me she liked me, her name is alexa and she&#x27;s very pretty. She seems healthy/happy and has a big personality, she&#x27;s really nice (polite) too. I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s joking, because fo a month now I&#x27;ve been hearing she liked me. In fact 3 more girls are &quot;said&quot; to have liked me, but it could just be jokes? The last girl was just an attention seeker, so she decided to try and trick me, why??? But this time the girl seems genuinly nice and a good person to hang around, so what do I do? I&#x27;ll talk with her, and just be friends, maybe in the future I&#x27;ll like her (her personality is amazing). I&#x27;ve never had a girl friend, but many girls have liked me, because I try my best to be <strong>good</strong> company, someone someone wants to be around. To do that you must be, a good person, and a strong person. I&#x27;ve liked many people, but I way the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s too much. It may sound like a brag, but just be someone who people will wanna be around. By being good, athletic, strong, or just a charismatic person.</p>
<p>I must improve myself, so that one day I&#x27;ll have the courage to ignore everything for love, but right now I&#x27;m uncertain about too much. So why persue something half, why regret later? I dunno, but I cannot, I can not date. I&#x27;m not in any situation too, at least in my head I&#x27;m not. I will waste time then, be productive. Currently 5:44, wasted time till 5:10, then exersiced. I will now do something.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heritable genetic variation; the variance in added variation in offspring?</li>
<li>Epistatic; the interaction between genes, like friends who work together relationship</li>
<li>Sexual reproduction and mutation cause the HGV</li>
<li>Traits, ussualy things that are not heritale, like scars (they dont pass on)</li>
<li>Natural selection is the effect of HGV</li>
<li>Group behaviour, schools of fish, migrating flocks, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently 6:35, I will relax? Dunno what it is I&#x27;m doing, I should be more productive. Currently 10:32 at night, what did I do? I watched some videos about frisbee (ultimate frisbee), because tomorrow is tryouts for the fribee team. I played outside with my brother fro 30 minutes, then ate dinner, then went to a dessert cafe. The dessert cafe had so many options, I picked chocolate brownie and hot chocolate milk. It was tasty, but the portion size was off the charts, they were massive. The glass was super thick, so it made it look like even more than it already was. I tried some croffel that my parents bought, it was exquiset, better than any icecream. My brother got rocky road, it was good too.</p>
<p><em>Next day, relaxed, slept.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-30th">April 30th<a href="#april-30th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to April 30th" title="Direct link to April 30th">​</a></h3>
<p>Tomorrow is may 1st, the big day, the concert. I am MC, this is gonna be fun. I practiced and prepped, but it still feels like I should do some more. I&#x27;ll study, then do it.</p>
<p>By the way currently 7:50, I went to school, practiced, heard the concert preview. Tried out for frisbee team, hope I get in. I also relaxed for a bit, then spent like 1 and half hours texting this girl alexa. She seems nice, she told me her entire life story, I told her some of mine, people&#x27;s circumstances are crazy. Fourteen siblings is a lot, but anyways I like her, she likes me back. She is my type, I told her, she said she liked me back. But I feel guilty, I told her I&#x27;ll explain everything tomorrow. Anyways, Im just studying.</p>
<ul>
<li>3x(y+y)</li>
<li>(x)(5x*5+y)</li>
<li>(y+4*x)(x+4+4+4)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all factorable.</p>
<ul>
<li>3x(y+y) + 5</li>
<li>(x)(5x*5+y) + 21</li>
<li>1 + (y+4*x)(x+4+4+4)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not factorable, why? Because they dont have much in common, I think. Moving on:</p>
