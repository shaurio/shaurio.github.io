<p>It is now october, first month of school is over, I mean first month of highschool. Ha, it&#x27;s crazy, I&#x27;m already in highschool, I have so many regrets. Though I could&#x27;ve had more, I will work on not having regrets, moving on with my mistakes.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="october-1st">October 1st<a href="#october-1st" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to October 1st" title="Direct link to October 1st">​</a></h3>
<p>The start of october, I mainly worked on my project for geography. I am happy with it, I don&#x27;t regret doing it. I&#x27;m getting better at soccer, not bad, not bad at all. Today I ate delicious butter paneer my mom made, my gosh was it good.</p>

<p>Yep, oct 2nd already. Last week my science teacher taught us how to read the perioidic table, it was mindblowing. I can mow draw out what the atomic structure of an atom looks like, that is on the perioidic table.</p>
<p>Now 6:00, man I&#x27;ve been wasting time, I feel horrible. Just really perturbed, filled with regret, I feel terrible. Ahhh... Dang it, I speak so boldly of not doing things you would regret, but I&#x27;ve made mistakes. It&#x27;s okay, I am better for it, I simply will be better; I have to be.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="october-3rd">October 3rd<a href="#october-3rd" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to October 3rd" title="Direct link to October 3rd">​</a></h3>
<p>I woke up feeling great, if your not something, fake it till you make it, cause then it isn&#x27;t faking at all.</p>
<p>I got ready for my field trip, to the farmers market, there are farmers market everywhere. This one was particulary large, and cool.</p>
<p>I kickscooted to school, went to class, when it was my 2nd period class I left and put my chromebook in my locker, so I dont lug it around during the trip. I boarded the bus, and drove the the market. There are lot&#x27;s of wierd people, so choose who you want to be friends with. Are they worthy of being your friend? This only applies if your strong (confidence, power, muscle, intellect) enough to hold (gain, make them go to you) their friendship.</p>
<p>I look for people I want to ebe friends with, genuine people who are not stupid. This is why everyday is a fun day, and everyday is worthwhile, as I gain meaningful things with meaningfuly thinking people.</p>
<p>Anyways, once there we were told to stay in groups, I was with Conner, Ayaan, Abihjot, Shaurya. We had an assignment to complete, it was to ask the shopkeepers and vendors at the farmers market about their business, like how did they make it, what did they do to make it succesful, and what not. We first finished the assignment, (got there at 10:45) it was around 11 or so when we finished finished. We bought churros in celebration, it was a massive place. Anyways, lunch rolled around and we had lunch, yes. My friend bought 2 small (not worth it) slices of pizza, and I bought a poutine that was 8 in by 6in large. They cost the same, but my poutine was way bigger and way more filling. It was like a 3 course meal, so much food, it cost the same as the two slices of pizza.</p>
<p>Anyways, I had fun, bought some things, ate some mroe things, and just had an amazing time. That was truely awsome, I handled myself really well in conversations.</p>

<p>I went to school, and I did things there. I feel as though I&#x27;m getting ot know more epeople, and classes are fun.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="october-5th">October 5th<a href="#october-5th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to October 5th" title="Direct link to October 5th">​</a></h3>
<p>Studied, woke up, played games, ate ham, had a great day.</p>
<p>I went to this park with my parents, the wetaher was perfect, the park had no people, it was beutiful. I know understand more about quadratic equations, my mind has opened up, I have absorbed knowledge. I can know understand what it looks like, poorly, very poorly, but I&#x27;m improving.</p>
<p>By the way! My handgrippers arrived, remember how my old one broke? I bought metel ones this time, a 50lb, 100lb, 150lb, and 200lb. This cost $20, pretty good price, for pretty good quality. I though I would be able to do 150 easy, but I can barely do it, with my entire effort. I need to get gripping away, so I can do 150 with ease, cause 100lb is easy, but 150 is a challenge. Now for the 200lbs, I.. no, it&#x27;s really hard. I cannot get it to close, I can&#x27;t, not yet, I will retry when I am stronger.</p>
<p>My teacher at school has a 150lbs one, so I asked to try, it&#x27;s kinda easy. But the 150lbs one I have is hard, so hard I struggle to close it. Anyways, I will keep working on my business project.</p>

<p>Hung out with friends and enjoyed the last day of the long weekend, thanksgiving. I studied a good amount, trig, I wanted to get better at trig. I learned the basics of triangles and Soh-cah-toa, sine cosine tangent, etc. Opp/hyp, adj/hyp, opp/adj, and getting the side length using the angles and one other known sidelength. I also learned how to get the angle, using inverse trig functions, I am thinking of finsihng up trig and moving to precal, since I don&#x27;t know very much of it (I think so at least).</p>

<p>Went to school, dang these days are getting colder, and I, wiser. Ha, well I&#x27;ve changed a lot since coming to canada, it feels as though it&#x27;s been 2 years. I came in 2023, now it&#x27;s almost the end of 2024, I&#x27;m now also in highschool, crazy. Though it was bound to happen, going to highschool, since we all grow up eventually. I am exited about it, though I will miss these days of just relaxing all day, and studying happily.</p>
<p>I still have things I need to imporve on, like my hair; I cannot decide on a hair style, so I wear a cap. I havent felt my hair as short and spiky since a long time ago. Anyways, I feel busy these days, maybe that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not writing as much in here. Time is flying, and I&#x27;m the one in the cockpit. So yes, I can say it is flying, but I&#x27;m the one flying it, so I cannot complain. A passenger, a driver, it makes no difference, they all get dragged along in the end.</p>
<p>Jeez, highschool is so much fun, though I&#x27;m in a nice place, with amazing friends, so it&#x27;s all peaches and roses. I love it, this sense of.. well anyways, it isn&#x27;t bad here. Kinda feels like middle school in the U.S, people are kinda childish here, it&#x27;s amazing. In middle school back in the states, everything was tense, so you can only imagine highschool there. Though, now I&#x27;m a big kid, and a great man to be, and I will prevail over american highschools.</p>
<p>I kinda want to join a scince fair, though they start in may, and I&#x27;m joining kinda, late? Maybe.</p>

<p>This month is flying by, though it is so much fun. I&#x27;m loving highschool, because I try to make it enjoyable (good friends, good envirnment, equal good state of being).</p>

<p>A thursday, dnd club, man that was fun. Dnd is so much fun if you play with the right people, do not play with weirdo&#x27;s (this is subjective), play with people you mesh (can function well) with. I found a group of amazing friends, very nice, to play with (so it is fun). Anyways, you choose who you wanna play with, also the story really matters. I&#x27;ve found dungeons to be the most fun so far, an exploration with a goal.</p>

<p>I went to the schools robotics club, turns out it was the last day to join. Imagine my luck, great! I hadn&#x27;t relised there was a robotics club, since they did a club display day (and robotics wasn&#x27;t in it). They should do a better job of promoting clubs, terrible, really bad at promoting clubs.</p>
<p>Anyways, it was fun, we tampered with a vex robot, and dang that was cool. We can make our own battle bots, after we finish the vex robot.</p>

<p>Played soccer with friends, then went to play basketball. I went from huron to rbj, it was crazy.</p>

<p>Today was sunday, I kinda relxed. Though my back pain is getting worse, the muscle knotes pinch so much it feels like it&#x27;ll stop the blood soon. I walk, it hurts, so badly too. I&#x27;ll keep trying to get better.</p>

<p>I, my time, I feel as though it is flying. Man are the days just passing by, it&#x27;s already almost halloween. 10 more days</p>

<p>A tusday.</p>
<p>Only 9 more days.</p>
<p>I have been frequenting this math club, it&#x27;s mind opening. I mean I asked a 5th year there, what was the proof of:
sin(∠abc + 60°)</p>
<p>He explained imaginary numbers, euluers identity, many other things, cos(x) in the imaginary (complex) plane, also sin(x). And how y/r has some constitution to radius in general. You know, I should go there more (it&#x27;s every tusday). Today is tusday, not &#x27;was&#x27; tuesday.</p>
<p>I know that it&#x27;s: sin(∠abc) * cos(60°) + cos(∠abc) * sin(60°)
I merely wanted to know why, and he explained many proofs and eucladian seires&#x27;s. I did not fully understand it (one bit), though it was a learning experiance. Since i^2 = -1, and i^3 = negitive. I suppose it&#x27;s imaginary for a reason, since what on the standard number line is equal to: &#x27;the root of -1?&#x27;</p>
<p>I still don&#x27;t know his name, although I do know his passion for math burn bright. Oh yeah, many numbers come up in my mind.</p>
<p>cos(2*∠abc) = cos^2(∠abc) * sin^2(∠abc)</p>
<p>sin(2*∠abc) = 2 * (sin(∠abc) * cos(∠abc))</p>
<p>cos(∠abc + 60°) = cos(∠abc) * cos(60°) - sin(∠abc) * sin(60°)</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t get why the formulas are &#x27;such&#x27;, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s complex (get it? complex, complex plane?? ha).</p>

<p>I feel horrible today, I feel so dang bleak, haaa... but I have things to do, and I know I&#x27;ll do better next time.</p>
<p>I have things to do, I must do them, I have goals to complete, they feel distant (I, yeah). I feel as though I have no time, since I&#x27;m wasting it away (it&#x27;s flying, too fast), school is fun. Jeez, 4:50 becomes 5:50, then now 6:50. Time is moving too fast, though I suppose it&#x27;s not, me using the time makes it seem faster.</p>

<p>I am not getting enough sleep, I sleep a at 11, but actually fall asleep at 12. I wake up at 6, to get ready for school.</p>
<p>Anyways, I went to the dnd club today, it was a blast, really.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="oct-25th">Oct 25th<a href="#oct-25th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Oct 25th" title="Direct link to Oct 25th">​</a></h3>
<p>I feel more angry, getting irritaded and doing/saying this I normally wouldn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m just getting mad, and the funnist part is that I agree with myself, I don&#x27;t think I did anythign wrong. Though judging people is harsh, anyways, I need to lock in on my goals.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m losing sight of it all, this week has been incredibly challenging in that aspect, it&#x27;s testing my will. It&#x27;s testing my passion, my drive, and I will follow through.</p>
<p>I learned the reciprocalsd of trig functions, not too hard, I also learned about trig in non-right-angle triangles. It&#x27;s mindblowing, all of it.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been studying for an hour and 50 minutes, currently 10:50. I felt so horrible before, like dead tired, aching muscles, but rememebered my goal (I feel super light now). My body is in shambles, we went to the weight room for gym class, fun but taxing (I overdid it).</p>

<p>Felt kinda sick today, I studied a bit, I am finding it hard to make time for anything.</p>
<p>I went trick or treating with my family, at an event. I was like 6,1 with boots on, my boots are like 10 inches tall. Aside from that, I dressed up as batman. I was batman, yes, why? The idea of a hero, I liked that, so I drssed up. I put on my leather jacket, some jeans, and a mask. I looked pretty damn cool. People were nice, even though I was so &quot;big&quot;, they gave me candy.</p>

<p>Yes, 4 days till halloween, not bad. I plan on going to the movies with my friends today, I am evolving (I am cutting things I don&#x27;t need from my life, games, stupid things, etc). Ha, not bad, nto bad at all.</p>
<p>I have a test on canadian geography on.. well tomorrow. I studied from 10, till 12:30, ate lunch, now it is 12:56. I am still studying, why? Well I don&#x27;t have enough time to study, I think I&#x27;m studying literly one day before the test (what the heck).</p>
<p>I watched venom 3, it was awsome, I&#x27;m not one to watch movies, but it was really cool. I think you should watch it, since it was like an unfulfilling journey that left you stunned. I was very surpirsed by the ending, but I wont tell.</p>

<p>Today was a monday, I kinda just went to school and studied a bit.</p>

<p>I kinda just went to school, it rained, and studied a bit. I make it sound dull, but really every day so much fun.</p>

<p>Today! Wednesday! Day before halloweeen!!!!</p>
<p>I worked on my presentation, practiced and everything.</p>

<p>I wore my nice leather jacket to school, and presented, it went pretty alright. It was not the best, everythibg went great, but could have been better.</p>
<p>Anyways, dnd club was fun, then at 6 I went trick or treating. Like 14 friends were there, some of which I hadn&#x27;t seen since 8th grade. It was amazing, ha.., it went perfectly, excatly how it should&#x27;ve gone. I got a ton of candy, when I wasnt even trying to get candy, just sort of have fun with friends. My brother came too, he was a tiny magician.</p>
<p>By the way, I was dressed up as batman, it is only fitting. And my best friend in canada was joker, which was awsome, since I only relised batman and joker were from the same universe yesterday.</p>
<p>Well november is coming, it&#x27;s been a long time since I came to canada, it&#x27;s been great.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div
