<p>Just went <strong>sledding</strong> with my family, studied and had fun. There&#x27;s this park nearby with lots of open space, I found some sledding spots and enjoyed sledding for the very <strong>first time</strong>. Funny thing is, the day before, on new years. I went <strong>Ice skating</strong> with my family for the <strong>first time</strong>. So the last two days have been amazing.</p>

<p>My dad introduced me to &quot;<strong>markdown</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Vs Code</strong>&quot;. Thats how I started this. He also taught me how to compile and run code in the &quot;<strong>terminal</strong>&quot;, I used <strong>web editors</strong> for coding not an application. Another thing he showed me was how &quot;<strong>github</strong>&quot; worked and how to use it for <strong>web develpoment</strong>.</p>
<p>Im honestly surpirsed how cool &quot;<strong>markdown</strong>&quot; is. I&#x27;ve used &quot;<strong>C</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>html</strong>&quot;, and &quot;<strong>python</strong>&quot; before. But this is very simple. Probably because its used for <strong>static websites</strong>. You really dont need any prior knowledge of coding for &quot;<strong>markdown</strong>&quot;. If you&#x27;re reading this, <strong>Vs code</strong> is a really good pair for &quot;<strong>markdown</strong>&quot;. Another resource I was using was called &quot;RasberryPi&quot; its amazing, if your my age, check it out. It has resources, machine learning, robotics, scratch, C, html, python, and its kinda fun.</p>

<p>Today I took the &quot;<strong>course challenge</strong>&quot; for <em>8th grade</em> in &quot;<strong>Khanacademy</strong>&quot;, it has lots of stuff. I learned about many different concepts in math too. I never knew about <strong>rational</strong> and <strong>irriational</strong> numbers till now, I also did some <em>algebra</em>. While studying I realized <strong>I lacked practice</strong>, I was busy doing <strong>A.I</strong> and <strong>Coding</strong>. I also did a bit of scratch.</p>
<p>I should balance my time. Another thing I did was add changes to this website, mainly changing the <strong>color</strong> and adding slight changes here and there. Go to my <a href="http://localhost:3000/docs/tutorial-extras/dev-log" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>dev log</strong></em></a> for more detail on my new additions. Anyways today I spent most of my time just <strong>studying</strong> basic 8th grade concepts. My dad says <strong>foundation is important</strong>. On a side note, I went walking with my dad. Today went fast, and I dont feel like I did much, but maybe thats because I was studying most of the time.</p>
<p>Currently trying to add a <strong>logo</strong> to this site, but I dont know how. Im not familair with importing <strong>browser images</strong> to my <em>local editor</em>. Regardless, I decided to change the color theme to <strong>green</strong> and <strong>yellow</strong>. It looks really rough but It&#x27;ll do.</p>

<p>Today, I wrote to my teachers. I recently moved to <strong>Canada</strong> from the <strong>U.S</strong> and decided to write to my old teachers. I made lots of memories at <strong>Borel middle school</strong>. I wrote to them on how I went <strong>ice skating</strong> and how the snow is great. Anyways, other than that, I did some <strong>S.A.T preperation</strong>. Im going to <strong>9th grade</strong> in about a year and need to prepare for my <strong>S.A.T&#x27;s</strong>. On the S.A.T, we may be asked to write our own system of linear inequalities based on the word problem, and find a solution to the system we wrote. I learned about the foundations: substitution, elimination, etc. I also leanred how to better apply it to word problems. Another thing I leaned was about systems of equations, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;<strong>Mike</strong>&quot; has <strong>6 more</strong> <strong>years</strong> of teaching experciance than &quot;<strong>Sally</strong>&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;<strong>Mike</strong> and <strong>Sally&#x27;s</strong>&quot; teaching experiance <strong>combined</strong> is <strong>16 years</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many <strong>years</strong> has &quot;<strong>Sally</strong>&quot; taught?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sally</strong> has taught <strong>5 years</strong>. <strong>Mike</strong> has taught <strong>11</strong>. Hence <strong>5 plus 11 is 16</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But anyways, I added more things to this site. I changed the logo to &quot;SM&quot;, meaning &quot;Shaurya Mohapatra&quot;. I also changed the background to yellow and green, it looks great. I liked blue, but then I searched up &quot;Best pairing colors&quot; and saw green and yellow together. I used canva to make the logo and all the other SVG&#x27;s. Canva is amazing, huge time saver. Another thing I did was make it look better by adding frontal images.</p>

<em>Screenshot of front page, its a bit rough</em></p>
<p>Now, I mostly studied and coded today, pretty good. I also learned about classes and how to change them. Another thing is that you can use inspect to change colors instantly. Basicly learned some useful tips from my dad. Here is the summary.</p>

<p>Today I played around with scratch. Scratch is fun, its simple. But anyways, I did some S.A.T prep and learned more about how to solve word problem <strong>systems of linear equalities</strong>. Like real world problems, its comparitive algebra mixed with inequility between vaiables. Like:</p>
<ul>
<li>An uber costs $20 for the base fee, and $10 for every hour on the road.</li>
<li>You have $90 and need to get to an event 6 hours away.</li>
<li>How much more/less would you need to get there using the least amount of money?</li>
</ul>
<p>( 10h + 20 ≤ 90 ) = ( 10h ≤ 70 ) = ( h ≤ 7 ). Its 6 hours away, so substitute h with 6.</p>
<ul>
<li>(h = 6) &lt; 7</li>
<li>So 90 - 10(6) - 20 = 10</li>
<li>10 dollars less.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also learned some A.I stuff from an book called &quot;The little book of deep learning&quot;.
Heres a quote:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Although the bulk of deep learning is not difficult to understand, it combines diverse components such as linear algebra, calculus, probabilities, optimization, signal processing, programming, algorithmic, and high-performance computing, making it complicated to learn.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Seems about right, anyways. I learned about &quot;Decision trees&quot; from &quot;experience A.I&quot;, its by &quot;Rasberry Pi&quot;. Its pretty cool, check it out for A.I stuff. By the way, Rasberry Pi has lots of stuff other than A.I, but &quot;experience A.I&quot; is focused more on A.I. The basics are &quot;Class&quot; (What it is) and &quot;Labels&quot; (What you call it). But &quot;class&quot; is a way to identify groups of things by their label. If there is a Bananna class, things labeled &quot;bananna&quot; fall under that class. A decision tree sorts or classifies groups of things. Like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it have more than 4 sides? True -&gt; Not a square</li>
<li>False -&gt; Is the width and height the same? True -&gt; A SQUARE!!!</li>
<li>False -&gt; NOT a square!</li>
</ul>
<p>Something like that, but better looking. Another way is to show a picture:</p>

<p>Today I went to Niagra falls with my family. It was fun, the water fall had icicles all around it. Its still winter so everywhere around it was wet, cold, but scenic. I got back at like 3 or 4:00. Anyways, I tried making an A.i that detected faces in Scratch, that failed. So I tried making an A.I that identfies if a text is rude or not rude. Its working pretty well. The site I used to make it is called &quot;machinelearningforkids&quot;.</p>
<p>Another thing I did today was some math work. I learned some more practical uses of linear equations. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jake wants to run an average of 10 miles each week this month. (4 weeks)</li>
<li>First 3 weeks: 8, 12, 10, x</li>
<li>What is the 4th weeks mile counter? (Average = weekly)</li>
<li>(8, 12, 10, x)/4 ≥ 10 . . .  2+3+2.5+(x/4) ≥ 10  . . .  7.5 + (x/4) ≥ 10</li>
<li>x/4 = 3.5 . . . (x/4) * 4 ≥ 3.5 * 4 . . . x = 14</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, other than that I didnt really do much. Half my day was spent sightseeing, it was really cool.</p>

<p>Today I built two snowmen with my family. Snow is really fun to play with, I also did some sledding. Another thing I did was check out <strong>Chris Albon&#x27;s</strong> machine learning notes, I just wanted to see what there was. There was loads of notes on <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>A.I</strong>. Seems pretty cool. Heres what I understood:</p>
<p>Four types of A.I: (According to Hala Nelson)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception AI</strong>: Learns from <strong>data</strong>, like data from its environment, then finds <strong>patterns</strong> within the data, then decides. <em>(Pattern recognition)</em></li>
<li><strong>Understanding A.I</strong>: Image labeled bananna, gets eaten. Image labeled chair, gets sat on. <em>(Classifying/Understanding the <strong>function</strong> of the image)</em></li>
<li><strong>Control A.I</strong>: Controlling robots, navigating spaces, <strong>info</strong>, etc. <em>(The brain, uses other A.I to carry out a controlled funtion)</em></li>
<li><strong>Awarness A.I</strong>: Similar to a human, <strong>combination of other A.I</strong> to become <strong>intelligent</strong>. <em>(Artificial Intelligence)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>While I dont have much knowlege in A.I <em><strong>yet</strong></em>, I do know that our brain <strong>signals</strong> other parts to do things. Anyways, this note came from a book on A.I called &quot;<strong>Essential Math For A.I</strong>&quot; <strong>by Hala Nelson</strong>. They could be right, or wrong. This seems to be plausibe though. Take it how you will, but this is just someones <strong>notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Data driven A.I rely on <strong>data</strong>, labeled or unlabeled data. Another thing I saw in his notes was called &quot;<strong>Dimensionality Reduction</strong>&quot;, compress data but better the performance. Like if something takes a while to load, or takes lots of &quot;Space&quot; then you can <strong>compress it</strong>. Imagine your A.I has to much junk, <strong>clean it up</strong>. I vagely understand the concept myself, but it seems useful for anyone using large scale A.I models.</p>
<p>Something cool I saw was called &quot;<strong>Clusttering</strong>&quot; I&#x27;ve heard this term before, my idea of it is grouping/clustering similar objects. Like bananna, apple, pear; And rock, tree, dirt. I grouped them by <strong>edible</strong>, and <strong>not edible</strong>. They have similar characteristics, but are <strong>more different</strong> from the other group <strong>than similar to their own</strong>. I kind of understand this, its similar to classification, but somehow different. In his notes it says:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;Clustering is an exploratory data analysis or pattern discovery technique that allows us to organize a pile of information into meaningful subgroups (clusters) without having any prior knowledge of their group memberships. Each cluster that arises during the analysis defines a group of objects that share a certain degree of similarity but are more dissimilar to objects in other clusters, which is why clustering is also sometimes called unsupervised classification.&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Quote from Chris-Albon/Clustering/<strong>Python-Machine-Learning</strong>-Chapter 1</p>
<p><em>The book is called &quot;Python Machine Learning&quot; By Sebastian Raschka.</em></p>
<p>That seems about right to me. In the future I will continue to look at this guys notes, they seem useful. This wasnt the only thing I did today. I also cleaned up the <strong>U.I</strong> too.</p>

<em>Screenshot of this website</em></p>
<p>Looks nice right? Anyways, another thing I did today was a bit of maths. I was mostly doing other things than math today.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clare has to get somewhere 420 miles away</li>
<li>She goes <strong>at least</strong> 60 miles per hour</li>
<li>And <strong>at most</strong> 70 miles per hour</li>
<li>What is the <strong>least amount of time</strong> she could get there?</li>
<li>60 ≤ 70 . . . <strong>Minumum</strong> 60  . . . <strong>At most</strong> 70</li>
<li>420/70 = 6 . . . 6 hours at least</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, I did some more math and here&#x27;s something to note:</p>

<p>This photo shows how graphs can help with linear equations, for some cases it can be really useful.</p>
<p>Honestly kinda bored, 7:15 right now, been doing math for 1 and a half hours. (Im tired, I have school starting tomorrow.)</p>

<p>Today, I had school. We are back at school after a <strong>two week holiday</strong>, something to note is. In scinece class, our teacher introduced us to &quot;<strong>TinkerCad</strong>&quot;. She wants us to 3D print a model of a cell of our choice, then make it into a key chain. Its not too difficult, because in the past (<em>California</em>) I have used <strong>&quot;TinkerCad</strong>&quot;. Its pretty good for making <strong>3D models</strong>, I will link it down below. Anyways, half my day was spent on school. Got lots of homework too :\ .</p>
<p>I have french homework, since im in <em>Cannada</em>. Its not too diffcult, but its not easy at all. Since I just moved to <em>Cannada</em> a couple of months ago, french is new to me. But thats fine, in class we are learning about <strong>congugation</strong> (tenses of speach Ex: Past tense). We had a test recently, I got a <strong>33%</strong>. Not good, not good at all. The test was about, knowing basic words, forming sentences, forming resposes, and writing the meaning of sentences. Its hard, for me at least. I even studied for that test and still got a bad score. Anyways, I also did some math.</p>
<ul>
<li>2y = 4x + 2(3) We need to simplify</li>
<li>y = 2x + 6 How do we get X and Y?</li>
<li>Simple! Use a <em>graph</em>! Like this:</li>
</ul>

<em>Screenshot from a google graphing calculator</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out the <strong>slope</strong>, y-intercept, &amp; more... (Kinda hard) Or use google!</li>
<li>x = 12 y = 30 Now we substitute</li>
<li>30 = 2(12) + 6 . . . 30 = 24 + 6 . . . 30 = 30 ✓</li>
<li>You can also do (<strong>10,2</strong>) but I was just showing an example</li>
<li>This seems pretty useful to me, its easy once you get it!</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, this was just something I thought was pretty cool and handy when you have this kind of question. After this, I did my french homework. French seems like a cool language I guess. It sounds amazing too, but its harder than <strong>Mandarin</strong> speaking wise. In my elementary school days, I went to a <strong>chinese immersion school</strong>. I spent <em>5 years</em> learning chinese, it was cool. Right now, I remember almost nothing. I get the gist of conversations though.</p>
<p>Its now been an hour &amp; 24 minutes of french, its pretty boring, but im learning lots. I think after an hour and a half of doing anything, It gets boring (<em>Unless you really like it</em>). I also did some scratch.</p>

<p>Today, I felt like I had no time. I spent 30 minutes doing Scratch. I created a ball and bat game, designed to mimic the <strong>physics</strong> of real baseball. It worked perfectly! Meanwhile, I completed some of my science homework, which wasn&#x27;t that bad. It&#x27;s currently 7:09, and I should start working on my assignments. However, I dont know what work I need to do. I feel productive, but I didn&#x27;t accomplish much at home. Science took too long.</p>
<p>At school, it was <strong>snowing heavily</strong>. The snow was up to my ankles and was compact. Around 10:30 and 11:00, we took our first break. I played soccer with my friends and noticed that it was <strong>hailing</strong>; small pebbles of snow were falling. Although it was inconvenient, it was also cool to see.</p>
<p>In Canada, we don&#x27;t have one <em>singlular</em> lunch break. Instead, it&#x27;s divided into two breaks, one in the morning and another in the afternoon. This will change in <strong>high school</strong>. After the day ended, we went outside and noticed that it had started to rain heavily. The ground was slippery and slushy due to the wet snow, which wasn&#x27;t great. My entire shoe got soaked.</p>
<p>Anyways, I will do my work now.</p>

<p>Today, I had a lot of fun. It snowed and rained last night, leaving the school grounds very slippery with a layer of ice. Walking felt like ice skating. I played a lot of soccer and basketball today. Playing soccer in the snow is quite cool. In physical education, we began our basketball unit. I was hesitant at first, as I hadn&#x27;t played basketball since the 6th grade. I used to participate in a yearly tournament called &quot;<strong>Junior Warriors</strong>&quot;-if you&#x27;re in California, you should check it out. I made it to the finals but lost (I also played 4 seasons). After that, I drifted away from basketball and started playing soccer intensively. I practiced soccer every year, month, week, and day, and I became <strong>fairly decent</strong> at it. Anyways, I performed well in basketball during physical education today. I made the right choice, I had lots of fun with the friends I made in soccer.</p>
<p>Im gonna study now. Started at 4:30, ended at 6:05. Heres what I did:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr5-26064534902ff7a8ae855535527fb6ec.png" width="1420" height="1098" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Screenshot of a Plant Cell 3D model I made for my homework.</em></p>
<p>That took too long, anyways. I will do some math and come back. After doing some math I learned more about how useful graphs are.
Imagine you have a hard problem that is confusing, like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a system of problems, solve it!</li>
<li>You are given two equations solve for the system (<em>x,y</em>)</li>
<li>10y &gt; (8x - 80) + 2x</li>
<li>5y &lt; 5(5) - 5x</li>
<li>Get the answer in a system (<em>x,y</em>) possibility style</li>
<li>It should <strong>satisfy</strong> the system</li>
<li>. . .</li>
<li>I started with the first one &#x27; 10y &gt; (8x - 80) + 2x &#x27;</li>
<li>10y &gt; (8x - 80) + 2x . . . Now Simplfy!</li>
<li>10y &gt; 10x - 80 . . . y &gt; x - 8</li>
<li>We have &#x27; <strong>y &gt; x - 8</strong> &#x27; but how do we solve?</li>
<li>We graph, the slope is 1, b (y-intercept) is -8</li>
</ul>
<p>It should look like a <strong>dotted line</strong> with everything <strong>above the line shaded</strong>. [#/ ]
Everything in the shaded is a <strong>possible solution</strong> to &#x27; y &gt; x - 8 &#x27;.</p>
<ul>
<li>y &gt; x means everything above the line is shaded, anything on the line <strong>isnt a solution</strong> [#/ ]</li>
<li>y &lt; x everything below is shaded, anything on the line <strong>is not a solution</strong> [ /#]</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, back to the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have the first problems solution area, now we need the second</li>
<li>5y &lt; 5(5) - 5x . . . Simplfy!</li>
<li>5y &lt; 25 - 5x . . . y &lt; 5 - x . . . y &lt; -x + 5</li>
</ul>
<p>We now have &#x27; y &lt; -x + 5 &#x27; meaning the slope is -1 and the b (y-intercept) is 5. Now make a line on the graph for this, it should be dotted and have everything below shaded [ \#]. Once you have both, the graph should look like a <strong>giant X</strong> (Kinda).</p>
<ul>
<li>So now we have 2 lines that intersect</li>
<li><strong>y &gt; x - 8</strong> (Green)</li>
<li><strong>y &lt; -x + 5</strong> (Pink)</li>
<li>Here is what is looks like:</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr6-14aef5f672f6eafb2b2e36161884c91e.png" width="2664" height="718" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Screenshots stitched together from KhanAcademy/S.A.T/Systems-of-inequalities-Video</em></p>
<ul>
<li>All the green shaded in area satisfies the &#x27; y &gt; x - 8 &#x27;</li>
<li>And all the pink shaded in satifies the &#x27; y &lt; -x + 5 &#x27;</li>
<li>That means that where they overlap, <strong>satisfies both</strong>, meaning it satisfies the system</li>
<li>Now pick a point and solve/check to see if its correct (Satifies both)</li>
</ul>
<p>I picked (-2,0), you can choose you own.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lets solve . . . 0 &gt; -2 - 8 . . . 0 &gt; -10 ✓</li>
<li>Second one . . . 0 &lt; -(-2) + 5 . . . 0 &lt; 7 ✓</li>
<li>. . .</li>
<li>Therefore one solution is ( -2 , 0 )!</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice, it works. For a minute I thought I got the problem wrong. Well, if you think this was useful, great! This seems cool to me, It will probably help me when I go to <strong>highschool</strong> (In a year or so). It is 8:17 right now, this was cool. I understand this more now that I tried explaining it myself. Anyways, thats what I did for the last 2 hours. Dang.</p>

<p>Today, Its thursday. I did stuff at school, then came home at around 3:54. Its currently 4:13, now 4:14. Anyways, Im gonna study. Never mind, I played games. Its now 4:23. Back to work I guess.</p>
<p>Just doing some more math:</p>
<ul>
<li>If y is &#x27; &gt; &#x27; than mx+b, shade <strong>above</strong> the line</li>
<li>If y is &#x27; &lt; &#x27; than mx+b, shade <strong>below</strong> the line</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greater than &#x27; &gt; &#x27; or less than &#x27; &lt; &#x27; signs mean points on the line <strong>aren&#x27;t a solution</strong></li>
<li>A dashed line shows that the points on the line <strong>aren&#x27;t a solutio</strong>n</li>
<li>And &#x27; ≥ &#x27; or &#x27; ≤ &#x27; signs mean points on the line <strong>are a solution</strong></li>
<li>We use a <strong>solid line</strong> to show that points on the line <strong>are a solution</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Just now I spent the last 30 minutes making a problem then trying to solve it. I failed, I had no clue how to solve it. Im gonna try it again but <strong>differently</strong>.</p>
<p>Solve the system:</p>
<ul>
<li>3y = (3^2)x - 2(3)</li>
<li>6y = (-6x + (24/3 * 3))/3</li>
</ul>
<p>We got to simplfy now: (Took a while, got distracted)</p>
<ul>
<li>3y = (3^2)x - 2(3) . . . 3y = 9x - 6 . . . y = 3x - 2 ✓</li>
<li>6y = (-6x + (24/3 * 3))/3 . . . 6y = (-6x + 24)/3 . . . 6y = -2x + 24/3 . . . y = -1/3x + 4/3 ✓</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that its simplified:</p>
<ul>
<li>y = -1/3x + 4/3</li>
<li>y = 3x - 2</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr7-ead6a7686d2f7e4503f2df681afa1e78.png" width="1326" height="658" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>Screenshots stitched together from google graphing calculator</em></p>
<p>So, where do they <strong>intersect</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li>They intersect at (1,1) . . . Its (<em>x,y</em>)</li>
<li>Is it right?</li>
<li>1 = 3 - 2 . . . 1 = 1 ✓</li>
<li>1 = -1/3 + 4/3 . . . 1 = 3/3 . . . 1 = 1 ✓</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, so the answer is (1,1). This isnt the question I got wrong but part of it. Anyways this was just some random math. Its currently 5:44, I ate an apple. Right now I dont know what to do. I&#x27;ll just study some A.I studying, might as well use my time well.</p>
<p>Alright, I spent a couple minutes and read about &quot;<strong>Regression</strong>&quot; its a type of <em>A.I learning</em> where you <strong>explain</strong> how the item does what it does. Then <strong>tell</strong> what it does. The <em>A.I</em> it supposed to <strong>find relationships</strong> between them. Thats why its called &quot;<strong>Regression</strong>&quot;. The name of this procces is &quot;<strong>Regression Analysis</strong>&quot;. The formula is <strong><em>Yi =f(Xi, β) + ei</em></strong>. I dont understand it, but it seems to mean that the answer/solution is <strong>based</strong> on the function of a <strong>set of rules</strong>, thats set to an &quot;Unknown parameter&quot; like <strong>question</strong>. Then check for errors.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a <em>bannana</em>, I can eat it</li>
<li><strong>Whats the purpose of eating it</strong>? Why is it eaten? Is it good or bad? ETC</li>
<li>It already knows what a <em>bannana</em> is, and what these words mean</li>
<li>But its supposed to make a <strong>connection</strong> as to why that happens</li>
<li>. . .</li>
<li>I have a <em>ball</em>, I kick it</li>
<li>Why would you kick a <em>ball</em>? To where would you kick it?</li>
<li>ERROR? Y/N</li>
</ul>
<p>This is my guess. The solution is the answer to these questions (Why kick it?). The answer to these questions are found by putting the <strong>prompt</strong> (I have a ball, I kick it) through a <strong>set of rules</strong> (Data similarities) and getting an <strong>answer</strong> back (Its fun). It is a type of supervised learning (Rules/parameters). This is just what I understood of this. Right now its 6:05.</p>
<p>I searched this up on google and I found that it has to &quot;identify the <strong>associations</strong> between variables occurring in some data&quot;. Something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a <em>bagel</em>, <strong>I eat it</strong></li>
<li>Why? Its edible &amp; tasty</li>
<li>I have <em>rice</em>, <strong>I eat it</strong></li>
<li>Why?</li>
<li>Well, since I ate the &#x27; <em>bagel</em> &#x27; ... &#x27; <em>rice</em> &#x27;  is probably also <strong>edible or tasty</strong></li>
<li>. . .</li>
<li>Edible (Able to be eaten) , Tasty (Pleasant to eat)</li>
<li>Could be provided in Data, you <em>dont</em> have to</li>
<li>It will treat edible as (x) and tasty as (y)</li>
<li>I eat <em>Bagel</em> = x + y . . . Therefore . . . I eat <em>Rice</em> =? x + y</li>
<li>The <strong>context</strong> is probably important, similarities need to be found</li>
<li>This is what I understood at least</li>
</ul>
<p>You can look it up yourself if you want to know more. I only covered what I understood, these are my notes. Do not take this as the <strong>exact definition</strong>. I dont fully understand it. (6:14)</p>
<p>Im gonna read about some more stuff and come back. Alright, just read about &quot;<strong>One VS Rest</strong>&quot;. It is a type of <em>classification</em> that decided on what an <strong>unlabeled</strong> item (Or data) belongs to what <strong>class</strong>. One <em>class</em>, versus the <strong>rest</strong>. Whichever class the model has the most <strong>confidence</strong> in, it will place the <strong>item</strong> (Or data) in. Like:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 3 classes,</li>
<li>Red, Yellow, Green</li>
<li>Which class should I put a <em>bannana</em> in?</li>
<li>It is sometimes <em>green</em>, but mostly viewed as <em>yellow</em></li>
<li>So I have a <strong>80% confidence</strong> that the <em>bannana</em> belong in the <em>yellow</em> class</li>
<li>. . .</li>
<li>This is a stripped down example</li>
</ul>
<p>OvR as its called is used in the case of <strong>perceptron</strong> (A simple model of a biological neuron in an artificial neural network). This was according to &quot;<strong>TechTarget</strong>&quot;. It seems that if you have a <strong>decision tree</strong> like model (Or nural network), having this would be helpful. Because it would <em>classify</em> things based on <strong>confidence</strong> based from <em>data</em>. Its like a blender, you need fruit to make a smoothie. Something like that I guess.</p>

<p>I got home at 3:54 and it&#x27;s now 4:15. I&#x27;m going to take some time to relax. During the seventh period, I had <strong>DPA</strong> (Outdoor time), followed by a <strong>break</strong>. I played for an additional hour during the break. Then, after the break, I had <strong>physical education</strong> and played for yet another hour. In total, I played for four straight hours. I feel lazy.</p>
<p>I read about this concept called &quot;<strong>Underfitting and Overfitting</strong>&quot; its where you might underfit or overfit the model for <em>classifying</em> data. Underfitting is where you dont give it (The model) <strong>sufficient data</strong> and sufficient <strong>good quality</strong> data. Its like if you take a test without studying properly, you&#x27;d do worse than if you had studied. I believe overfitting is where you give it not enough data for it to be <strong>accurate</strong> if faced with something <strong>different</strong>. Like:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I show the A.I 10 images of bannanas</li>
<li>Then show it an apple, and ask what it is</li>
<li>How would it know without <strong>prior data</strong>?</li>
<li>It would not know (Yeah)</li>
</ul>
<p>Overfitting, fit for a <strong>spesific</strong> job (input spesific). Underfitting, unfit for <strong>any</strong> job (dumb). Another example is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you get someone whos good at math <strong>ONLY</strong></li>
<li>And you give them a science test</li>
<li>Would they have <strong>good</strong> marks?</li>
<li>Most likely not (Unless they trained)</li>
<li>. . .</li>
<li>Imagine you have two people taking a test</li>
<li>One studied, another didn&#x27;t</li>
<li>Whos getting the better score?</li>
<li>Most likely the <strong>one who studied</strong></li>
<li>. . .</li>
<li>Or, imagine someone studied for a test</li>
<li>Only to find out, they studied the wrong topic</li>
<li>They studied algebra, the test is on angles</li>
<li>Would they do good?</li>
<li>Maybe (If they trained in that)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some examples of <strong>overfitting</strong> and <strong>underfitting</strong> in <em>real life</em> terms. I could be wrong though.
It is currently 4:59, now 5:00. I will do some more reading up on A.I and math.</p>
<p>Im back, I read a little about <strong>capacity</strong> and <strong>flexibility</strong>. The models capacity is its <strong>flexibility</strong>. Flexibility is how the model <strong>handles</strong> different <em>data</em>, Like:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you give your model data for <strong>all</strong> fruits</li>
<li>Then while you test (Train) it does good</li>
<li>That means its <strong>flexible</strong> on the topic of fruits</li>
<li>. . .</li>
<li>If you give your model data on <strong>ONLY</strong> apples and bannanas</li>
<li>Then during testing (Training) it can&#x27;t identify a plum, orange, etc</li>
<li>That means its <strong>not flexible</strong> with fruits</li>
</ul>
<p>Its better to have a model fit for the job and be flexible. Those two go <strong>hand in hand</strong>. And on the off chance its not flexible enough, it causes <strong>underfitting</strong> (Bad outputs, not accurate). Flexibility is based on how <strong><em>deep</em></strong> its learned. Like:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you give model 1, 20 images of apples</li>
<li>And you give model 2, ten images of apples</li>
<li>Model 1 would most likely be more accurate and fit for the job</li>
<li>It would be <strong>more flexible</strong> on the topic of apples <strong>than model 2</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, my example explains it. Anyways, I was bored and asked the <strong>Phind A.I</strong> about <em>A.I</em>. This is what it said:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;...the rise of AI is not without its drawbacks. One concern is the potential for increased human dependency on machines, which could lead to a decline in cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills. The automation of tasks by AI could also result in job displacement, as machines can handle repetitive tasks more efficiently than humans. Moreover, the ethical implications of AI, such as privacy concerns and the need for unbiased decision-making, present significant challenges that must be addressed&quot;</em>
-<em>Quote from <strong><em>Phind A.I</em></strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>A.I</em> makes a good point, but all of this is possibly <strong>biased</strong>. It took info/data from many sources, those sources could be <strong>baised</strong>. <em>A.I</em> thats been <strong>tampered by humans</strong>, like setting <em>limitations</em> and other things would undoubtedly be baised. But, I could be wrong. Anyways, Im gonna do some math now. Didnt do math, instead spent an hour fixing days 8-12. Its now 6:37, wow.</p>
<p>Just got back from going outside, its currently 7:09 and I went outside during a snowstorm to experience it. I went with my dad, we made snow angels, snow balls (Threw them), and cleaned our car. At 5:00 it wasnt snowy at all. Now 7:00 its a snow blizzard. The snow is so soft. While making snow angels I felt how it was like clouds. That was cool. Anyways, maybe now I&#x27;ll do math?</p>
<p>Wasted about 40 minutes playing games. Im gonna do math now. It was 5:00 when I first said I will do math, now its 7:40.</p>
<p>Spent a little doing math. Anyways, onto the next day.</p>

<p>Today I woke up and saw that it had snowed everywhere. The snow storm from yesterday was still going on. It was sunny at 2:00 then super dark at 5:00.</p>
<p>Today, I will do math. Alright, after 15 minutes im stuck on a problem. This is the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solve the system and find x</li>
<li>3x + y = 3</li>
<li>7x - y = 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe I should do some graphing?
Lets try that.</p>
<ul>
<li>3x + y = 3 . . . 3x - 3 = -y . . . y = -3x + 3</li>
<li>7x - y = 2 . . . 7x - 2 = y . . . y = 7x - 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, this is getting somewhere</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the value of x? We need to graph</li>
<li>After graphing it looks like:</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr8-e85d5213546bf434846adeb28e48f902.png" width="1126" height="412" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Screenshot of google graphing calculator (Desmos calculators work too)</em></p>
<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem right. I dont know but the solution to the system being (0.5, 1.5) looks wrong.</p>
<p>Lets check:</p>
<ul>
<li>3(1/2) + 1.5 = 3 . . . 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 . . . 3 = 3 ✓</li>
<li>7(1/2) - 1.5 = 2 . . . 3.5 - 1.5 = 2 . . . 2 = 2 ✓</li>
</ul>
<p>It was correct. That means the X in the system is 1/2. It said I was right on khanAcademy. Nice.
On khanAcedemy I saw some things I might as well note down.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ratio</strong>: 3 <strong>to</strong> 2 = 3:2</li>
<li>Like 3 bannanas <strong>to</strong> apples</li>
<li>. . .</li>
<li><strong>Proportions</strong>: 3 <strong>for every</strong> 2 = 3/2</li>
<li>Like <strong>for every</strong> 3 bannanas, I have 2 apples</li>
<li>. . .</li>
<li><strong>Rate</strong>: 3 in <strong>per</strong> apple = 3 in / 1 apple = 3 in <strong>/</strong> apple</li>
<li>Like three inches <strong>per</strong> apple</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just something that might come in handy later.
Im gonna do some A.I stuff now.</p>
<p>I read this thing called &quot;<strong>Mutual information</strong>&quot;, its similar to &quot;<strong>Regression Analysis</strong>&quot; but it uses <em>values</em>. Like 0 to inf or something. Regression is where the A.I checks previous items and data to find similarities and (Or) class them by confidence. This however is checking for similarities and putting values on it. When &quot;MI&quot; (Mutual information) is zero, you dont know anything simlar about each item. Like: (These values are hypothetical)</p>
<ul>
<li>Firehydrant = Not edible</li>
<li>Apple = Edible</li>
<li>MI = 1</li>
<li>They both have something to do with edible</li>
<li>. . .</li>
<li>Crab = living</li>
<li>Dog = living</li>
<li>MI = 1.5</li>
<li>They are both living</li>
<li>So you could easily <em>class</em> them as &quot;Living&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Its where &quot;<em>one of many quantities that measures how much one random variables tells us about another</em>&quot; - <strong>Scholarpedia</strong>. Its more or less about how <strong>similar or related</strong> one thing is <strong>to another</strong>, and how much we can <strong>understand</strong> of the other vairable by <strong>understanding the other</strong>. Like:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have two variables x &amp; y</li>
<li>x = 5  and  x = y</li>
<li>So what is y? <strong>How can we tell</strong>?</li>
<li>y = ?</li>
<li>y = x therefore y = 5</li>
</ul>
<p>We could tell because x is the <strong>same</strong> as y, and 5. So then if we want to find y, we need to <strong>understand</strong> what x is. Just asked &quot;Phind A.I&quot; the same question, this was the response:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;If x = y and x = 5, then y must also equal 5. This is because the first equation states that x and y are equivalent, so whatever value x is assigned, y will have the same value. Since x is given the value of 5, y will also be 5.&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>— <em>Phind A.I</em></p>
<p>Its correct, it also explained why. This doesnt have much to do with the current topic, but I was just curious. So in summary, its two random variables measure of the mutual dependence between the two, according to <strong>Wikipedia</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A value closer to zero indicates less association between two variables</li>
<li>A value farther away from zero indicates more association between two variables</li>
</ul>
<p>This was according to <strong>Oneoffcoder</strong>, I will link these resources down below. Just checked the time, how is it already 12:00? Did some math 9:00 to 10:00, then did this. I took the &quot;Unit test&quot; in <strong>KhanAcedemy</strong> twice, got 90% then 100%. That means I spent two hours reaserching random <em>A.I</em> and math stuff. Time went by too quick. Alright, spent 15 minutes listening to music. Y&#x27;know, its funny, I dont like it when I see people with earbuds on. But here I am, with headphones listening to music. Anyways, back to work.</p>
<p>It is currently 2:40, I spent time just doing random stuff here and there. Now I&#x27;ll get back to work. Currently 5:44, never went back to work, instead. I went outside to play in the snow. It was fun, the snow was packing snow. I also played games with my dad for 30 minutes, then relaxed for a good 15 minutes. Now I&#x27;ll do some work.</p>
<p>Spent a while reseraching and making a phamplet:</p>

<em>Screenshot of my &quot;Health&quot; homework made with</em> <strong><em>Canva</em></strong></p>
<p>Pretty cool right? This took some research but turned out nice. I think it looks dramatic, thats how I wanted it to look. Smoking is bad, drugs are bad. But many people use them regardless.</p>
<p>Anyways, I went on khanAcedemy and saw something about ratios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part to part:</li>
<li>In a town there is 10 cows to humans = 10:1</li>
<li>. . .</li>
<li>Part to whole:</li>
<li>100 humans to a small town = 100:1</li>
<li>Cows to small town = ?:1</li>
</ul>
<p>Something like that, anyways. See you tomorrow.</p>

<p>Today, im just gonna learn. On the 7th, I told myself to do something on Jan 14th. Today is that day, but I dont know what to do. Just checked out what I wrote on day 7 and I remembered im supposed to update the Dev log. Wow.</p>
<p>Currently 6:26. What have I been doing? Well, I studied for a some time in the morning till 10:30. Then played games till lunch around 1:00. After that, I went walking with my parents for 1 hour 20 minutes. When I got home, I had a converstation with my dad for an hour. Then played games for 30 minutes. I left at 3:30, came back at 4:50. I played games half the time between 5:15 and 6:23. Started writing this at 6:23.</p>
<ul>
<li>How long did I play <em>games</em> in <strong>total</strong>? (x)</li>
<li>Solve!</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, after thinking I have the answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Studied till 10:30</li>
<li>Played games till 1:00 (13:00)</li>
<li>So 10:30 to 1:00 I played games</li>
<li>. . .</li>
<li>How much did I play here? (Time)</li>
<li>13:00 - 10:30 = 2:30 (2 hour 30 minutes)</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, we have half the &quot;day&quot; done. Now what after?</p>
<ul>
<li>Went walking for 1 hour 20 minutes (3:30 + 1:20 = 4:50)</li>
<li>Had a conversation for 1 hour (60 minutes) (5:50)</li>
<li>Then played games for 30 minutes (5:15)</li>
</ul>
<p>But anyways, the total so far is 3 hours of gaming.</p>
<ul>
<li>Left at 3:30</li>
<li>Came back at 4:50</li>
<li>4:50 - 3:30 = 1:20 (I hour 20 minutes)</li>
<li>This means the walk took more than an hour</li>
</ul>
<p>But, that does not mean too much in this equation. Our goal is to find the <strong>total</strong> game time. So far its 3 hours.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its currently &quot;6:26&quot;</li>
<li>And I was playing games half the time between 5:15 to 6:23</li>
<li>I started writing this at 6:23</li>
<li>Meaning that I couldn&#x27;t have been playing games at 6:23? Right?</li>
<li>No, I played games half the time between 5:15 to 6:23</li>
<li>That includes 6:23</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, the reason why its not 5:15 thorugh 6:22 is because 6:23 is included and not spesifically excluded. I hope that makes sense. I could&#x27;ve been playing before I started writing this. No one except me would know. Now time to solve:</p>
<ul>
<li>6:23 - 5:15 = 1:08 (1 hour and 8 minutes) or (68 minutes)</li>
<li>Half of 68 minutes is 34 minutes</li>
<li>Meaning we add 34 minutes to the total . . . (3 hours 34 minutes) currently</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice! We found out that I spent <strong>3 hours and 34 minutes</strong>. (Correct me if im wrong)</p>
<p>Anyways, its currently 7:40. What have I even been doing?? I&#x27;ve been relaxing today. And fixing stuff, lots of <strong>grammer</strong> and spelling.</p>

<p>Today, I went to school and then came back. Today is monday. I have some work, but its almost done. Im gonna study, do some hardcore math.</p>
<p>Right now Im learning about rates, ratios and proportions (Foundations)
Like:</p>
<p>If a college asked 50 students to take a survey about how happy they are, and 13 were freshman, 14 were sophmore.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What does 13:14 <strong>represent</strong>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part to part (Part of an equation, compared to another part)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does 14:50 <strong>represent</strong>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part to whole (Part of the equation, compared to the whole equation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does 50:14 <strong>mean</strong>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It means that for every 50 students, 14 of them are sophmore&#x27;s</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stuff like this, its important to know basics before jumping into hard (Complex) stuff.</p>
<p>Another one is:</p>
<p>There are 84 ice cream cones, 1/3 are large sized. There are 2 sizes, large and small.</p>
<ul>
<li>How <strong>many</strong> are <strong>large</strong> sized?</li>
<li>There are 28 large sized ones (84/3 = 28)</li>
<li>What is the ratio between <strong>small</strong> and <strong>large</strong> size? (x<!-- -->:y<!-- -->)</li>
<li>The ratio is 2:1 (1/3 is large so 2/3 is small)</li>
<li>What is the ratio between large and <strong>all</strong>the cones.</li>
<li>The ratio is 1:3 (1/3 is large and 3/3 are cones)</li>
<li>How <strong>many</strong> are <strong>small</strong> sized?</li>
<li>28 = 1/3 so 56 = 2/3 (28 * 2 = 56)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, back to work. After doing some proportions, I dont get why proportions is a thing. Fractions already exist, but proportions are just fractions named differently. It might have some significance, but I dont see why you woulden&#x27;t say &quot;Give me a fraction of that&quot; instead of &quot;Give me a portion&quot; its the same thing. But, It probably exists for a reason. As most things do.</p>
<p>I take it back, its somewhat usefull. Like if you have a difficult question like: (This may or <strong>may not</strong> be difficult for some)</p>
<p>There are 138 cars lined up in front of you. Every car has <strong>4 tires</strong>. Your job is to clean each tire. Your boss wants all the cars done in <strong>less than 2 days</strong>. It takes you <strong>5 minutes</strong> to clean <strong>each</strong> tire. Can you do it? <strong>Yes or no</strong>. (Imagine you dont take any breaks. Or sleep, or anything)</p>
<p>Lets simplify it terms wise.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have 138 cars and <strong>each</strong> car has 4 tires</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, that makes sense. So 138 * 4.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&#x27;s a <strong>total</strong> of 138 cars * 4 tires = 552 tires to clean</li>
<li>It takes <strong>5 minutes</strong> to clean each tire</li>
</ul>
<p>Yup, 552 tires to clean in 4 days. Each taking 5 minutes. Seems <strong>impossible</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, the total time required to clean <strong>all</strong> tires is 552 x 5 (minutes) = 2760 (minutes)</li>
<li>Turn minutes to hours . . . 2760 (minutes) ÷ 60 (1 hour) = 46 (hours)</li>
<li>Because 24/6 = 4 and 2400/60 = <strong>40</strong></li>
<li>And 36/6 is 6 so 360/60 is <strong>6</strong></li>
<li>So 40 + 6 = <strong>46</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, now we figured out how long it will take, but is the answer <strong>yes</strong> or <strong>no</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days would give you 2 days x 24 = 48 hours</li>
<li>But 46 &lt; 48 so yes, <strong>yes</strong> it is possible</li>
</ul>
<p>This is theoretical, there no way someone can properly clean all these tires with these bad conditions. But, im sure someone has a job worse than this. Damn.</p>
<p><em>Alright, its 6:27, I took a short break and ate some food.</em> Now back to work.</p>
<p>I saw something intresting about rates, its kinda useful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A car is traveling at 150/5 miles/hour. It left the driveway and drove for one day and 6 hours nonstop to a lake. It took 3 hours and 20 minutes to get to the next lake. How long did it take to get to the second lake from the driveway? (How far will it have traveled in 1 day 6 hours + 3 hours 20 minutes?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the car is going 150/5 miles <strong>per</strong> hour. That means that for every 150 miles it has been 5 hours. We should simplify.</p>
<ul>
<li>150/5 . . . 30 miles per hour</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically 150/5 is then 30/1</p>
<ul>
<li>So 30/1 hours * 30 hours = 30 * 30 . . . 900 miles so far</li>
</ul>
<p>It traveled at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 30 hours, which is the duration of 1 day and 6 hours. Using the formula (distance = speed x time), I got 900 miles. I don&#x27;t have much practice doing these types of questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>And 30/1 hours * 3 hours = 30 * 3 . . . 90 miles (990 miles so far)</li>
</ul>
<p>It went 30 mph for 3 hours, so 90 miles. When I explain it, it makes so much sense.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also 30 miles per hour means 30 miles per 60 minutes</li>
<li>So 30:60 &amp; 1 mile per 2 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>I used the fact that you can use ratios to make life easier, 30 miles for every 60 minutes is 30:60. That means we can simplify it and make it a lot easier. These questions look so hard, they kinda are though.</p>
<ul>
<li>That means 10 miles per 20 minutes so 1000 miles in <strong>total</strong>!</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice, we found out it will go 1000 miles in however long it took. That was a little (Very) difficult. I kept messing up, like 3 or 4 times. The problem I wrote, was different than the one I was solving. Never mind.</p>
<p>To be honest, we couldve just found out the total minutes (2000) and ratioed it. If the total minutes is 2000 then what is the total miles? Miles = minutes/2. That means 2000/2 is the amount of miles the car went. This was an easier way. But, I did not relize it untill after I did all this. Wait, this is mindblowing. I took the total time, then found the ratio for it. Then solved. This is amazing. I never knew it could be solved this simply. I gotta learn more about this.</p>
<p>Anyways, its currently 8:38. I am bored.</p>
<p>I will show the other way to solve the car problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 miles per hour = 30 miles: 60 minutes</li>
<li>So 30:60 . . . 1:2</li>
<li>Every mile takes 2 minutes</li>
<li>Every 2 minutes is a mile</li>
<li>How many minutes in total? 2000</li>
<li>That means 1:2 * 2000 . . . 2000:4000 . . . 1000:2000</li>
<li>1000 miles <strong>for every</strong> 2000 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>There, we got the answer, <strong>1000 miles</strong>. Getting the total minutes is kinda hard. But if you already know how many minutes a day is (1440), you can solve anything. This is useful, Im glad I did this. I learned a fair amount today. Its currently 8:45. I will relax now. I do not feel like doing anything. Got school tommarow.</p>

<p>Today, I had school. Its currently 4:53. I relaxed for about an hour. Now back to work.</p>
<p>Heres a question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tony wants to buy 6 large pizzas. Small pizza&#x27;s cost 2.00 dollars <strong>less</strong> than large ones. Ten large pizza&#x27;s cost 129.90 dollars. Mark wants to buy 10 small pizza&#x27;s. (<strong>No tax</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How <strong>much</strong> will Tony&#x27;s order cost? ($)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How <strong>much</strong> will Marks order cost? ($)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lets start with Tony:</p>
<ul>
<li>He wants 6 large pizza&#x27;s (6L)</li>
<li>Ten large pizza&#x27;s cost $129.90 (10L = 129.9)</li>
</ul>
<p>In these types of problems, the first thing you need to do is find how much <strong>one unit</strong> of pizza costs. In this case, 10 of them costs 129.9 dollars. If we find how much one costs, we can find out how much 6... or <strong>any</strong> amount of pizza&#x27;s cost.
I dunno but I know ((10L)/10) * 6 = The answer. Im the one who made the problem anyways, with <strong>inspiration</strong>. From khanAcedemy.</p>
<ul>
<li>1L = 10L / 10</li>
<li>10L = 129.9</li>
<li>6L = 1L * 6</li>
</ul>
<p>Replace/<strong>Substitute</strong> the &quot;L&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>1L = 129.9 / 10 . . . 12.99</li>
<li>6L = 12.99 * 6 . . . 77.94</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(</strong> <em>[12 * 6] + [ {99 * 6} / 100 ]</em> <strong>)</strong> or (72 + 5.94)</p>
<p>I found out how much one of them costs by making <strong>both sides</strong> the <strong>same</strong>. Then substituted &quot;1L&quot; with &quot;12.99&quot;. Yeah. After that, I found how much 6 pizza&#x27;s cost by <strong>muliplyin</strong>g the cost of one, times six.</p>
<p>So Tony&#x27;s order costs $77.94</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cool</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now for Mark&#x27;s order:</p>
<ul>
<li>He wants 10 small pizza&#x27;s (10s)</li>
<li>A small pizza is $2 <strong>less than</strong> the large ones (L = s + 2)</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, we know what he wants, and how to get it. S = L - 2 if you understand where im going with this, good.</p>
<ul>
<li>s = 12.99 - 2.00 . . . 10.99</li>
<li>10s = 1s * 10</li>
<li>109.9 = 10.99 * 10</li>
</ul>
<p>I found out how much s is by understanding that s is 2 <strong>less than</strong> L (s = L - 2). After that, I found out how much 10 is by multiplying s by 10 (s = 10s / 10). Now we know 10s = 109.9 dollars.</p>
<p>Nice, Marks order is $109.9</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alright</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thats it for this problem.</p>
<p>Next problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A type <strong>B</strong> car has four tires and one steering wheel. John wants to know how many tires are in 92 type <strong>B</strong> cars, he needs to change lots of tires. Help him out. After that, he needs to change 12 type C cars. Type C cars have 6 tires. How many tires will he clean in <strong>total</strong>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright, so for this question. We need to find how many tires John has to clean.</p>
<p>Lets figure out much type B tires amount to:</p>
<ul>
<li>B = 4 tires</li>
<li>92B = 4 * 92 . . . 368</li>
<li>368 tires so far</li>
</ul>
<p>([90 * 4] + 8) or (360 + 8)</p>
<p>You dont need to (But can) ratio or proportion it, but I just simply <strong>multiplied</strong> 4 by 92. So far tires are 368.</p>
<p>Now we gotta figure out how <strong>much</strong> type C tires amount to:</p>
<ul>
<li>C = 6 tires</li>
<li>12c = 6 * 12 . . . 72</li>
</ul>
<p>(60 + 12) or 72</p>
<p>We need to add 72 to 368.</p>
<ul>
<li>60 + (368 + 12) . . . 60 + 380 . . . 440 tires</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, John has to clean <strong>440</strong> tires. Good luck, poor John.</p>
<p>Why am I doing this? It&#x27;s <strong>easier</strong> to <strong>learn</strong> when you try to <strong>teach</strong>, because you have to <strong>understand</strong> what your teaching <strong>to teach</strong> someone else. It&#x27;s very cool. I understand these types of questions better now. Anyways, Im gonna take a break. Its 6:45. Dont feel like taking a break, I will fix day 16. It is currently 6:58. Now I&#x27;ll take a break. Slept, next day.</p>

<p>Today, I dont remember when I got back. I took a shower and its currently 4:27. I feel so lazy, its a Wensday.</p>
<p>Anyways, heres a problem:</p>
<p>This was inspired from KhanAcedemy, I did not entirely make this. I had trouble answering it though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building A is 140 ft tall. Building B is <strong>half</strong> of &#x27; A &#x27; plus 10 ft. Jake wants to know how tall building D is. He knows building C is 90 ft tall. The ratio between A &amp; B is the same as C &amp; D. (A<!-- -->:B<!-- --> = C<!-- -->:D<!-- -->)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How <strong>tall</strong> is building D? (Rounded)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lets understand whats going on first:</p>
<ul>
<li>A = 140 ft</li>
<li>B = 85 ft<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>A<!-- -->:B<!-- --> = C<!-- -->:D</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>C = 90 ft</li>
<li>D = ?<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>C<!-- -->:D<!-- --> = A<!-- -->:B</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We know A, B, and C&#x27;s height. We also know that A &amp; B&#x27;s ratio is the same as C &amp; D. So it will be the same ratio.</p>
<ul>
<li>140:85 = 90<!-- -->:D</li>
</ul>
<p>Proportion it</p>
<ul>
<li>140/85 = 90/D</li>
</ul>
<p>Get rid of the denominators by multiplying both sides by they&#x27;re denominators. To get rid of division, we have to multiply.</p>
<ul>
<li>(140/85) * 85 * D : (90/D) * 85 * D . . . 140D : 7,650 . . . D = 54.64~</li>
</ul>
<p>I got rid of the denominators and then simplified, after that I just found out what D was. Now that we found out what D is. We need to round it. It should look like:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr10-23ada1b8c5620b272e5c62644b9868fe.png" width="1472" height="296" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Screenshot of stitched images from KhanAcedemy</em></p>
<ul>
<li>54.64 ≈ 55</li>
</ul>
<p>D is ≈ to 55. It said it was the right answer, nice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cool</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now, Im gonna try some highschool KhanAcedemy stuff. I dunno, im bored I guess. Probably wont understand a thing anyways. Just got back from doing like 15 minutes of highschool statistics. Its not hard, but I dont get the right answer. I understand it, I just dont get it. Never mind, I&#x27;ll just keep trying.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mean = All items / # of items</li>
<li>Median = The middle point, like 1 2 3 4 5. It&#x27;ll be like 3 or something</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#x27;s a statistical problem: (Basics)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ray asked a small class how many pets they owned, here is the result:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr11-cdcdb07aa338adb808e6ce7a3c6a48bd.png" width="930" height="296" class="img_ev3q"></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Image from khanAcedemy/highschool-statistics</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the <strong>Median</strong>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So lets write what we know:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 13 dots, we need to find the one in the middle</li>
<li>Go 6 either way to end up at &#x27; 3 &#x27;</li>
<li>The median is 3</li>
</ul>
<p>I found the dot in the center, thats it. Its not too complicated. KhanAcedemy said I was right too. Been doing this for about an hour, Im not tired, Im bored. I will take a break. Took a break for like 30 minutes. I downloaded steam, there&#x27;s this game I wanna play. Honestly I should start doing my work.</p>
<p>Hey, currently 8:55. Just ate dinner. Im going to work on a school project I put on the side. Worked for a bit, next day.</p>

<p>Got back around 4 and its currently 4:44. Been working on a school project for some time. Gonna take a break, I never did end up doing that. Its currently 5:13 and I am really tired. I dont know but today I feel very drained. Currently 5:50, got some work done. Dont know where the time went. What am I doing? I have homework, why? What do I do? I could play video games, I can do anything. I have so many choices I dont know what to do. I guess I will study. I don&#x27;t want to. I&#x27;ll play games after I study for an hour. Alright, lets do this.</p>
<p>What is an angle? Two rays that share a vertex. Intersecting lines or segmaents also make angles. I played games for a bit afterwards. Did not too too much today, just studied angles. Next day.</p>

<p>Woke up at 8:00 and ate breakfeast. Currently 10:00 but Im doing my school project. Feel good, gotta get it done. Got a lot of work done on my project. But, its currently 3:11. I played games for a while. That game I mentioned on the 14th, I started playing it yesterday at like 10:00 at night. Its pretty good. Anyways, Im gonna learn stuff, anything. After doing some project stuff, Im happy with my progress. Im using google slides, Im <strong>decent</strong> (really good) at animating using google slides. Its fun.</p>
<p>After reading a bit about &quot;<strong>One-hot Encoding</strong>&quot; heres what I learned. It&#x27;s supposed to make ML (machine learning) A.I improve they&#x27;re <strong>prediction accuracy</strong>. The language of computers 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s. Allows it to be more effective.</p>
<p>It looks something like:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr12-ba09bdbe7dffdd992840a96cff521d4f.png" width="1368" height="380" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Screenshot of something I made in google slides</em></p>
<p>As I was &quot;researching&quot; about &quot;One-hot Encoding&quot; I kept seeing &quot;<strong>Nominal data</strong>&quot; being brought up. I looked it up and it&#x27;s like a <strong>label or name</strong>. Like hair-color, names, and gender. Label based data <strong>I think</strong>. Never mind it&#x27;s <strong>categorical data</strong>. I believe thats the same thing though (I later found out that nominal data is a catagory of catagorical data). It sounds like nominal data is something thats not fixed like your name or preferences towards something. But what do I know. According to &quot;Cochrane&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Nominal data is classified without a natural order or rank, whereas ordinal data has a predetermined or natural order. On the other hand, numerical or quantitative data will always be a number that can be measured.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some examples of <em><strong>Ordinal</strong></em> data</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr13-46c1803c2afa83f7899cd5fe3c6899ce.png" width="998" height="486" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Screenshot of something I made in Canva</em></p>
<p>There were just some examples of <strong>ordinal data</strong>. It&#x27;s pretty cool how <strong>everything</strong>(All data) has a name and class like &quot;Ordinal data&quot;. Who&#x27;d of thought? Anyways, back to &quot;One-hot Encoding&quot;. The problem with it is that it increases &quot;<strong>Dimensionality</strong>&quot;, <strong>complexness</strong>. I covered a little bit on the <strong>reduction of dimensionality on Jan 7th</strong>. Incase you dont want to go up and check, heres what I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Another thing I saw in his notes was called &quot;Dimensionality Reduction&quot;, compress data but better the performance. Like if something takes a while to load, or takes lots of &quot;Space&quot; then you can compress it. Imagine your A.I has to much junk, clean it up. I vagely understand the concept myself, but it seems useful for anyone using large scale A.I models.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just relized that I wasn&#x27;t too helpful here. But I believe this is the gist of it. Dimensionality is basically many different <strong>features or qualities</strong>, especially in a way that makes something seem real, &quot;rather than being too simple&quot;. Like I said, the complexness. But what does this mean in ML? It means &quot;The number of input variables or features for a dataset&quot;, how complex it is. Something I saw while looking at real examples of Dimensionality, x and y are Dimensions. Z is another Dimension. If we have an X, Y, and Z Dimensions. A cube (x , y , z) would be <strong>more complex</strong> than a square (x , y). A square would be more complex than a line (x or y). I hope this makes sense but anyways. Why am I writing stuff here? So I <strong>learn</strong> instead of just remembering topics.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to the main topic of &quot;One-hot Encoding&quot;. It&#x27;s cool but as all things do, it gives and takes. Increases effectiveness, but makes it <strong>more complex</strong>. Something being complex is cool, but functionallity it important. Thats why simple &quot;desgins&quot; look better than complex ones. It&#x27;s kinda fun learning while listening to music, Im learning all these concepts that relate to real world things. Anyways, Ahem. Back to work.</p>
<p>I finished the topic about &quot;One-hot Encoding&quot; and its currently 5:00. How long have I been working (2 hours)? Enough for it to be dark outside. But, I learned about many things that will be useful Im sure. Alright, I&#x27;ll take a break. Come back and study for my test on tuesday. It&#x27;s about angles and stuff. Since Im in <strong>Canada</strong> &quot;we&quot; use F-patt, C-patt, and Z-patt. Never heard of that in the <strong>U.S</strong>. The program I was taking in the U.S was &quot;acceleratered learning&quot; where we do 2 times the amount of stuff. Im learning the basics all over again. But my (previous) classmates are progressing. Gotta catch up.</p>
<p>Whats up? Currently 7:00-ish and I never ended up taking a break. Spent the last 2 hours fixing Jan 11th through Jan 16th. I also played games. But the important thing is I fixed up those days and made it better. Not grammer wise but looks and feel. Alright, NOW I&#x27;ll take a break.</p>
<p>Played games for an hour, then ate dinner. After that I played for another hour. Next day!</p>

<p>Today I got up at 8:00. I started working on my school project, im getting good progress done. Anyways, just had breakfeast and its 10:30. Back to work. Currently 11:00-sih, I don&#x27;t know. I should study? Maybe. Went sledding with my family. Came back at like 1:00. Ate lunch, I made myself a <strong>5-star</strong> sandwich today. Currently 2:00. Maybe I should do some work. Did some work, now 2:30. Im gonna study.</p>

<em>Image from KhanAcedemy (edited by me)</em></p>
<p>Honestly just wanted to test if trasparent png&#x27;s would look good. It looks alright. Anyways, this is from KhanAcedemy and I thought I should put this here for later refrence. Complemetary, add up to 90°. <strong>C for corner</strong>. Suplementary, add up to 180°. <strong>S for straight</strong>. Currently 3:20, what have I been doing? I have been doing some math and reading novels. Gonna take a break, I just took one and now Im taking another. Currently 3:23. Now 4:00. Gonna exercise, haven&#x27;t done it in 2 weeks. It&#x27;s good for me.</p>
<p>Whats up? Currently 4:55. Did some exercise and I feel better. My shoulders look better too. Just thought of something, if someone says &quot;who asked&quot;, tell them &quot;You dont have to, your not a princess (or king, queen, etc)&quot; meaning they are entitled enough to think the other person cares if they asked or not. But, if your the one being annoying, dont. Currently 5:00.</p>
<p>Anyways, I should study some more I guess. That test wont ace itself y&#x27;know. Currently 8:51, I studied for a good 2 or more hours. Then I ate dinner, my mom made chicken. I studied angles with my dad till like 7:00, then played games for 30 minutes. So yeah, It&#x27;s now night. Im gonna work a little on my school project then go to bed.</p>
<p>I realize, Im doing good, but Im not doing enough. The next 4 years will determine my whole life. It&#x27;s so absurd I can&#x27;t procces it, when I was in 6th I thought people who studied like crazy were crazy. I only realize now how they are the ones who already proccesed that work hard now, relax later. This concept weeds out people with no drive from the rest. But it&#x27;s not people being weeded out, its kids. Kids who dont have enough life experiance to know whats important. But, the kids that do relize that beacome succesful.</p>
<p>Ignore that, Im gonna get back to work. It&#x27;ll be to late to prepare in 9th grade. Im trying to get to stanford or other reputable colleges. <em><strong>But, who isnt?</strong></em> My dad tells me it&#x27;s not just the people in the U.S competing with you, it&#x27;s the world. Get into a good college and you are set.</p>
<p>I have resources, and a brain. Im not poor or rich. I just need to study? Get achivements? Get a job? Then what? You need money to survive, and resources. Jobs give money, buy resources with money. Choose something you want to do for the rest of life. What do I choose? Im intrested in bio-tech stuff, like genetics, dna, what are we?</p>
<p>I have questions, what is human? Where are we? But, I&#x27;ll do that later. Me 30 years later, am I a scientist?</p>
<ul>
<li>What is me? How am I typing or thinking?</li>
<li>Is our universe just an atom to some other universe?</li>
</ul>
<p>Who cares, I kinda do. This is a blog, I put stuff I think or see. I see my laptop and table. I see snow outside. Im gonna do some thinking about the future. Maybe now, maybe later. All I know is learnings enjoyable.</p>
<p>I keep thinking things, comparing myself to others. I hold myself in a very high respect, Im tall (5,9?) and smart. I think my peers are not doing anything worthwhile. But, who knows. Some may have interned at NASA or SpaceX. We are teens, someone could&#x27;ve started a million dollar business. I don&#x27;t know if Im doing good, but thats respective to others. What am I doing. Sleeping.</p>
<p>What if the big bang was just a black hole that swallowed everything and imploded (Or exploded) again from being too big. That would explain why the universe is expanding, there is no friction in space. Throw something, it goes forever. We could be a test product of advanced aliens who wanted to test life. Who knows.</p>
<p>If something can collapse from being to big, it can deffinetly collapse from being &quot; - &quot; big. Are blackholes 4D?</p>
<p>Anyways!</p>
<p>Keep in mind I am 13 and will get taller.</p>

<p>Woke up in the morning, ate breakfeast. Played games for a bit, then my dad gave me a haircut. Currently 11:18. Dont know what to do. Just emailed an old friend of mine. His name is (Dash) William and he&#x27;s a great guy. We&#x27;ve known ech other for 8+ years. Im in cannada, hes in california. Anyways, back to work. Gonna work on my school project. Currently 4:30, what was I doing? I went to the park with my family after I made lunch. Came back at like 4:00. I relaxed then did some work on my project. Now, I will exercise? No, Im starving. I&#x27;ll eat first. Just did exercise and its now 5:54. I spent 5:40 - 5:54 reading. Im currently eating cookies called &quot;Dad&#x27;s&quot; they&#x27;re really good. Future me, buy them later. Anyways, Im gonna study. What do I study? 6:16, I do not know what to do.</p>
<p>Some stuff so I dont forget what I did in california. You can ignore it.</p>
<p>Whew. In california!!! Some clubs in Borel were on friday right after school. So I couldn&#x27;t go because I had basketball or some other thing. But I tried my best to be part of most clubs. I made friends with my teachers, so if anything extracurricular came up, they would tell me sooner. That&#x27;s why I tutored in 2022 and was a student counsler in 2023, connections and trust. I once visited my elemtary school in 2023 and they offered me a job to take care of the childrens annex (Mr.Lorenzo), I have to be in highschool though. My middle school also said Im welcome to be a counsler there (When im older), but I think they were just being nice. :)</p>
<p>Anyways! It&#x27;s 7:44 I have school tomorrow. What do I do? I should prepare for tomorrow. See you on the 22nd.</p>

<p>Got back from school and I don&#x27;t know. What do I do now? I have an angles test tomorrow. I will study. No need to study A.I or any other thing when I have a test tomorrow. Currently 6:00. I studied angles. It&#x27;s tedious but I need to get a good score, last time I forgot to put half of the answers down but still got 9/10. I wrote down my notes and wrote paragrapghs of evidence, but forgot to write the answers. Not gonna happen this time. These past 2 weeks i have not been writing a whole lot because Im busy with school. Currently 7:00, I studied some more. I will take a break? Did not take a break, ended up studying with my dad till more than 8:00. Now its 8:58 and I ate dinner and will sleep.</p>

<p>Today, I went to school. Recently I havent been putting many things here. I will try to learn more things, getting stuck on projects and other things takes time. But, I will do some more learning. Its about quality not quantity. Both are important. Anyways, I took a math test today. It was about angles and I think I did good. I&#x27;ll do some studying now.</p>
<p>Just now, I read about this thing called &quot;Target encoding&quot; It seemed intresting so I googled it and this is what I found.</p>
<p>One source said (H20.ai Documentation):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot; Target encoding is the process of replacing a categorical value with the mean of the target variable. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another source said (Target encoding done the right way by Max Halford):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot; Say you have a categorical variable x and a target y – y can be binary or continuous, it doesn’t matter. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot; For each distinct element in y you’re going to compute the average of the corresponding values in y. Then you’re going to replace each x with the according mean. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does this mean? Well what I understood was that in the first source by &quot;categorical value&quot; they mean data that cant be measured with numbers or numerically. Some catagorical data is; Race, gender, age group, height, and more. I dont think this makes sense but, you can call an entire group &quot;1&quot; and another &quot;2&quot; if your dealing with spesific problems relating to them. Like if I had two groups, apples and bannanas, I can say group &quot;1&quot; (apples) = 2. This does not make sense unless you have named it differently. Well 1 ≠ 2 so yeah. I mean if the names are &quot;group 1&quot; and &quot;group 2&quot; then it would work. What do I know? Anyways, I will read a bit on this and come back to give the real definition of &quot;Target encoding&quot;.</p>
<p>Never mind, decided to explore catagorical data some more and test out some stuff by making a machine model that identifies apples versus pinnapples. It works! Photo:</p>

<em>Screenshot of a ML model I made in &quot;ML for kids&quot;</em></p>
<p>I spent maybe 10 minutes doing this, Machine learning for kids makes it easy to do stuff like this. As you can see, the images are catagorical data you cant call them &quot;1&quot; but you can list them as &quot;1&quot;? Im still figuring this out. But this is still cool.</p>
<p>After testing it with some pinnapple images, this is what I found out:
<em><strong>You are</strong></em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr16-1b3bf212bd8965c0bd1e764edd83ac73.png" width="380" height="120" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>Screenshot of my findings, :)</em></p>
<p>Anyways, apparently most machine learning algorithms require the input data to be numerical. I mean the language of computers is 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s. I shall take a break and eat for 15-20 minutes, its currently 5:50. Now 6:20. I will continue to learn about target encoding. Im gonna read a bit and come back (Hopefuly).</p>
<p>After reading for a little bit (5 minutes) I saw something about &quot;Over-fitting&quot;, you can over-fit in &quot;Target encoding&quot;. You can over-fit in a lot of things. In target encoding, overfitting is doing something like tailoring to one spesific need. Like over dependent on something? Anyways, heres a diagram I made of target encoding:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr17-4f8595f4a80a2548cfa57272b021a224.png" width="1418" height="548" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>Something I made in google slides inspired by Kaggle&#x27;s diagram</em></p>
<p>I mean, once its put like this. It makes sense why someone would use that, it is cleaner and simpler. I just relized &quot;Ordinal data&quot; and &quot;Catagorical data&quot; are basicaly the same thing. Let me check. Apparently catgorical data is a catagory of data where things are catagorized. So ordinal data is a type of catagorical data. Wow, so is numerical data. Numerical data is something that can be measured. Like:</p>
<ul>
<li>20 people went to the theater this week</li>
<li>100 people bought candy from blank&#x27;s candy store</li>
<li>13 people liked this comment</li>
</ul>
<p>Stuff like that is numerical data. Thats cool, there are many different data types. Target encoding is great, some think it is the best encoding method, others think its one-hot encoding, you use either according to the situations. Target encoding reduces dimensionality, and one-hot encoding increases the dimensionality. So pick and choose which one fits the situation. Many believe one-hot encoding as the best because its simple use and clear way of showing data. They are both good, I am not speaking for myself as I dont have a use for them. If I ever wanted to do some catagorizing and grouping (With anything; how many times I ate today, How many hours I played games, etc) I could use these methods. Anyways, I will go eat dinner and or relax. Get it? Anyways, sayonara.</p>
<p>Relaxed for 15 minutes then ate dinner, currently 8:27 and I will go to sleep. Waking up is hard, for highschool I will need to wake up at 5:00 in the morning just to make it on time for school. My school is 45 minutes walking from my house, I have walked there before. See you tomorrow.</p>

<p>It is now 4:16 and I am lazy. I should work on my school projects, I have three. Gonna relax for maybe 15-20 minutes, then study. I also had a spelling test today, I know I did good, I studied. Currently 5:00, I spent much more than 15-20 minutes. Anyways, gonna work on my projects, I will focus on getting that done. Then learn more. Alright, currently 6:30 and I spent the last hour and a half doing my geography project about low HDI countries and high HDI countries. I was not productive, I spent most of the time just making animations for google slides. I am really good at it. Right now Im just going to.. let me think. Do some studying, I will study. What will I study? I will study the volume of cylinders. Tomorrow I will do spheres, the day after that I will do cones.</p>
<p>After studying about the volume of cylinders. This is what I learned. Whoever came up with the formula for Cylinders is a genuis, it&#x27;s smart. A cylinders is like a soda can or anything cylindrical, but how do we get the volume of a cylinder? We need to find the area of the circle at the top, then multiply that by how tall the cylinder is.</p>
<p>Imagine: (Based on khanAcedemy&#x27;s cylinder video)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have a cylinder with a the <strong>radius</strong> of <strong>5 cm</strong> and a <strong>height</strong> of <strong>10 cm</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Solve for the <strong>volume</strong> ( ?π cm ^3 <em>format</em> )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember that to get the volume, we need how wide it is, the height, and how long (Tall) the cylinder is. How do we find how wide and height-wise it is? We have the radius of one of the sides, thats all we need to find width and height. How long (tall) it is has already been given as 10 cm.</p>

<p>Just figured out how to do that. Anyways, lets solve for the circle area of our cylinder.</p>
<ul>
<li>Circle Area = π * r^2 Substitute</li>
<li>C`A = π (5 cm)^2</li>
<li>C`A = 25π cm^2</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we know the circle area, we need to times it by the height of the cylinder. Currently 7:30, where did the time go? Anyways, 25π cm^2 * 10 cm = Cylinder Volume. Lets solve.</p>
<ul>
<li>25π cm^2 * 10 cm = 250π cm^3</li>
</ul>
<p>We found out the cylinder volume by multiplying the area of the circle by the height of the cylinder. This is because the area of the circle is one slice of the cylinder. Like the circle is 2D and the height of the cylinder makes it 3D. Yeah, it makes so-so sense but once you relise that volume is a 3D thing it will make more sense. You can also find the surface area of the cylinder by finding the area of the both top and bottom circles, then add that to the surface area of the round cylinder part.</p>
<p>Like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The surface area of the circle is 25π</li>
<li>Both circles top and bottem will be 50π cm^2 (There are 2 flat sides to a cylinder)</li>
</ul>
<p>How we find the round cylindercal part is by finding the circumference of the circle by the height of the cylinder. A cylinder is basicaly a rolled up sheet of paper, then when we lay it flat, it is a simple rectangular piece of paper. Its height is 10 cm and its width is how long the circumference of the circle is. Lets find out. But first here is an image unrelated to the current problem:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr18-8860317d715498b577d9e8d214fd32a5.png" width="1278" height="516" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Screenshot of something I made in google slides</em></p>
<p>Get it? The circumference on the circle * the height of the cylinder is the surface area of the cylindercal part. It is kinda complex, but when illustrated it makes perfect sense. Anyways, Im going to eat dinner, then maybe do some work.</p>
<p>Back from dinner and I will now find the surface area of the cylinder. We know the 2 flat sides = to 50π cm^2. Now we gotta find the <strong>circumference of the circle</strong> in order to find (one side of the cylinder, then) the surface area of the cylindrical part. The diagram above explains it.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the formula for <strong>circumference</strong>?</li>
<li>C = 2πr</li>
<li>Alright so</li>
<li>C = 2π (5 cm)</li>
<li>C = 10π cm</li>
</ul>
<p>We know that one side of the rectangular cylindrical side is 10 cm and we just found out that the other side is 10π cm. The reason both sides are cm is because lines are a 1D construct. So lines are 1D, slices or 2D shapes; circles, squares, etc, then 3D is shapes with volume like sphere or cones. Cm = 1D. Cm^2 is 2D. Cm^3 is 3D. I&#x27;d imagine 4D being shapes without volume but with lines. Like you can see through walls, <strong>x-ray vision</strong> or something. I think thats what 4D is. Or maybe its where you can see all properties of an object. Anyways. Lets find the total surface area of the cylinder.</p>
<ul>
<li>10π cm * 10 cm = 100π cm^2</li>
<li>Cm * Cm = Cm^2</li>
</ul>
<p>So if we add that with our 2 flat sides, we get 100π cm^2 + 50π cm^2 = 150π cm^2</p>
<p>I believe I am right, you can check if you think Im wrong. I just checked google, I was correct! Lets goooo!!!! Anyways, I will now write about my theories. But first:</p>
<ul>
<li>A line times a line makes a square (2d)</li>
<li>Cm^2 * Cm^2 = Cm^3</li>
<li>A square times a square makes a cube</li>
<li>Cm^3 * Cm*^3 = Cm^4</li>
<li>A cube times a cube would be a tesseract (An imaginary 4D object )</li>
</ul>
<p>By this logic:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dot times a dot makes a line (1D)</li>
<li>A dot is essentially a cube being the height and width and length all the same as its not a line</li>
<li>Then that leads me to think that 4D is a line of 3D planes</li>
<li>Like a line of cubes, just like a line of dots</li>
<li>Maybe it repeats and becomes a cube eventually</li>
<li>By my logic it will look like this:</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr19-67a34819fbc95abe9bb95e029c055dd8.png" width="1594" height="620" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Screenshot of something I made in google slides</em></p>
<p>That looks like 1D, 2D, 3D all over again. But with <strong>volume</strong>. Thats just multiple 3D planes stacked on top of each other. Which is exactly what 3D is, mutiple 2D planes. 2D planes are made from multiple 1D planes. Do you see where Im going with this? It just repeats, maybe the universe is infinitly large, or infinitly small. All I know is we exist in the 3D plane, maybe someone 4D is walking around our world unknown because we can&#x27;t see them. I dunno, just speculations. By the way, Im going to highschool soon! This is a big year for me! Anyways, I will continue.</p>
<p>If in some way I was correct and 4D is indeed a line of 3D planes. Would you see an object and its past variants (past selfs) or would you see the same object but its properties (Like molecules or materials its made from)? Our existence is very cool, how do we move and talk? How are stagnant molecules and objects able to create <strong>motion</strong>? What is motion? DNA is code, who is the <strong>programmer</strong>? How do we change our code? Maybe one piece of DNA is limiting us from immortality, Im not sure but this is very intresting. Thats why I find bio-tech a cool subject. Never had it, but I plan too.</p>
<ul>
<li>1D is a line</li>
<li>2D has lines</li>
<li>3D has no lines</li>
<li>Can you guess what comes next?</li>
</ul>
<p>My guess is 4D has lines, and only lines. This is my idea:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr20.2-44adfbea613855858c0f6ebe25c98f6d.png" width="1974" height="708" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Screenshot of something I made yet again in google slides</em></p>
<p>This, this is intresting. Could a 5D being remove a past cube? I dont know, but I believe this to be something we should look into. I am 13 but when Im older, hopfuly I will look at this again. Anyways, moving on. Hypervolume, the meaning being <strong>extension</strong> mathematically. So 4D is an extension of 3D, 3D is an extension of 2D. So is 3D a hyper-2D space? Or is 2D a summation of 1D. What if its all of the above? Summation or &quot; ∑ &quot; is the notation for sums of terms that follow a pattern. Are dimensions summations of the previous ones? Anyways, 1+1=2 , 2+2=4, 4+4=16. This follows a pattern, I dont know what it mean though. Do you have any guesses? 16 = 4 (2 [1+1] + 2 [1+1] ) * 4. Anyways, superfuctions. What is a superfunction? According to Wikipedia superfunctions are &quot;a nonstandard name for an iterated function for complexified continuous iteration index&quot;. So by this logic, 3D is a parent to 2D, or is 2D the parent? Does it scale back (3D,2D,1D) or forwards (1D,2D,3D).</p>
<p>What I mean to say is did 2D make 3D, or is 3D the one that has/made 2D? It sounds absurd but it is still a question. Anyways, here is a quote I found intresting:</p>
<p>I quote from wisc.edu</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A 4-D being would be a god to us. It would see everything in our world. It could even look inside your stomach and remove your breakfast without cutting through your skin, just like you could remove a dot inside a circle by moving it up into the third dimension, perpendicular to the circle, without breaking the circle.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very cool, it begs the question about how if we are able to see 2D? We cant, we can simulate it in computers but we ourselves cannot see 2D. Maybe we can? I mean 3D is a bunch of 2D. So is 4D a kaleidiyscope of 3D? Whatever it may be...</p>
<p>Maybe blackholes are 4D, I think time is a straight line. Space is also a straight line, but space * time (and density) is our universe. So what happens when you take away space, does the objects that go in become 2D? Or does the objects that go in revert back to the properties it had beforehand (the past)? I dunno but its really intresting. Space is an empty void, does this mean space has volume? All things that have volume are finite, but blackholes have no volume. So according to the formula for volume and density, the density would be almost infinite.</p>

<p>If v = 0 then:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.0 =? m/m</li>
<li>No, 0 is not equal to 1</li>
<li>0 =? 1/10000000000000000000000000000000000</li>
<li>No 0 is not equal to 10^-34 or 1 tenth decillion</li>
<li>Zero is not infinitly small, it is void, null</li>
</ul>
<p>So then what is a blackhole&#x27;s density? Infinite, a singularity. But what is infinite? I dont know but its currently 10:30 and im heading to bed. I just wrote down some random stuff today. See you tomorrow.</p>

<p>Currently 8:00 in the morning and I will head to school. I walk, but it&#x27;s only like 15 minutes. When I come back, maybe I&#x27;ll study or write things. I did a lot of speculation yesterday. None of which was copied, I randomly thought of these things and wrote it down, this is a blog.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s currently 4:00, Im back from school. I reached level 106 on this game called text rpg, it&#x27;s fun. Anyways, I will study about spheres. I will eat first. Now I&#x27;ll study. I practiced finding the volume in a cylinder, I am ok at it.</p>
<p>Just studied a bit on spheres and I will now try to solve a question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find the volume of a circle with a diameter of 20 cm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright, so we know our diameter is 20. Diameter is twice the radius. Radius is from the edge to the center. The diameter is from one edge, passing through the center, then to the other edge. I&#x27;ll show a picture later. Lets solve</p>
<p>We know the raduis is 20/2 (10), the formula:</p>

<p>This is the formula, lets try to solve it.</p>
<ul>
<li>4/3 * π * 10 ^3</li>
<li>Calcutator: 4,188.7902047864 or 4,188.8</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what the calculator got. And here is how It got it.</p>
<ul>
<li>How It got it:</li>
<li>4/3 * π = 4.1887902047864</li>
<li>4.1887902047864 * 10^3 = 4,188.7902047864</li>
<li>Get it? First the squares then the rest</li>
</ul>
<p>I checked on google, it said this was right. If you have a calculator, finding the volume of a circle is simple. I alsways thought finding the volume of things were impossibly difficult. I mean, with a calculator everything&#x27;s easy. Currently 5:30 and Im lazy. This is what the sphere would look like in parts (This is the formula represented):</p>

<em>Screenshot of something I made in google docs inspired by mathematicsonline</em></p>
<p>I watched a video on how the formula for getting the spheres volume came to be. It was pretty cool, you make the sphere in to pyrimids then find all the pyrimids volume to get the total volume of the sphere. It&#x27;s complicated to say, but visually it makes sense. I will link it down below.</p>
<p>Anyways, now I know how to find both the volume of cylinder&#x27;s and spheres. I do not know them well as I took one day to learn each of them. I just did that so I know how to solve them in the very least. Tomorrow I will learn cones. Currently 6:30, I do not want to do homework. I dont have homwork I have 3 projects, I finished one today, but we got another also today. :( Yeah. One of my projects is about the comparison between two countries poor and rich. Then another is about writing 10-15 sentances in french summirzing a story. The third one is about writing and drawing and making a poster about a spesific character in the novel we are reading. We are reading ground zero, it was a cool book, we finished it. Moving on, I will take a 30 minute break and relax.   :)</p>
<p>Currently 8:47. My break took longer than expected. I relaxed for 40 minutes, made dinner, ate dinner, then wrote this. What am I doing now? Nothing, I am super tired, I want to sleep. But, I should fix this &quot;day&quot;. Done, now off to bed.</p>

<p>It is currently 5:00, I got back from school and have been relaxing since. Right now Im gonna excercise. I&#x27;ll be back. So right now is 9:00 in the morning. How? Well im actully writing this on jan 27th because I was not on my laptop from 6:00 onwards. Yesterday I mostly hung out with my family. It is important to have a day off sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Relaxed, rejuvinated, rested</p>

<p>Today I feel lazy, it is a saturday and I will now eat breakfeast. Alright, now Im gonna fix a lot of &quot;days&quot;. So many grammer, and &quot;summeries&quot; are missing. Be back in an hour or 2. Currently 10:30. Alright, after fixing all the days up to this point, it is currently 12:00. I will publish this blog this weekend.</p>

<em>Screenshot of my changes</em></p>
<p>After a bunch of tweeking and fixing, it looks nice. It is currently 12:30. I will now eat lunch. Spent an hour making pizza with my mom, it was better than domino&#x27;s, and every other good pizza place. Anyways, currently 3:00, I am relaxing. I should study a little bit. Curently 4:00, I will now study. After doing some cone volume theorm, it is cool. It&#x27;s apparently 1/3 the volume of what it would be as a cylinder.</p>
<p>So we know:</p>

<p>Now we solve:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have a cylinder with a radius of 2 and a height of 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the volume?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright lets solve. So 16π is the answer. How could I tell? I multiplyed 2 by itslef then multiplyed that by 4, after that I put and &quot; π &quot; in front of it to signify that its getting multiplyed by pi. Anyways, so a cone&#x27;s volume is the same as a sphere with the same radius. So if a cone has the volume of 16.75 cm^3 then a sphere with the same radius will have a surface area 3 times that of the cones volume. So Cone Volume/3 = Sphere Surface Area. Also a cylinder with the same height and radius will have 3 times the volume a cone with the same measurements will have. So-</p>
<p>Lets test that:</p>

<em>Screenshot of something I made in google slides</em></p>
<p>It makes sense, this is what I learned today. Currently 6:00. No clue what to do. I don&#x27;t want to study, I&#x27;ll excercise. Wasted 30 minutes playing games, now I&#x27;ll excercise. Currently 8:30, I ate dinner. Now im going to bed. Never mind, I played board games with my family. My notes today were very messy. Next day!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="january-28th">January 28th<a href="#january-28th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to January 28th" title="Direct link to January 28th">​</a></h3>
<p>Woke up, it is now sunday. The weekend will be over soon. It us currently 11:00, I ate breakfeast and am working on a school project. It is what I have been working on for a few weeks. It may seem like a waste of time to put effort into a school project, but it reflects me. Plus animating in google slides is fun. Back to work. Alright, now it is 2:00. I worked on ,my project and relaxed for the most part. The weekend is great, you have more time to do things. School takes half the day, we learn of course. But having more free time is great. Im gonna go eat lunch now. Now 2:30, I will study.</p>
<p>Right now Im studying unit conversion, the basics of it. Then I will progress, I have a hard time with these types of problems because of the conversion part. That is why Im studying this. Took a bath, currently 4:00. I watched an intresting video called &quot;Drawing the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th dimension&quot; it makes sense. So 3D looks flat to 4D, I mean to us, 2D looks flat. And in the part where they explained it, it looks as if it is multiple 3D dimensions stacked on each other. It makes sense, but at the same time it does not. The representation shown in the video looked like a 3D shape. I mean we are seeing it on a 2D surface. I watched another video that I had no doubts was the correct visual of 4D.</p>
<p>After doing some random stuff, its now like 7:00, I also excericed a bit.</p>
<p>Anyways, after studying and playing and relaxing. Its currently 9:00, Im going to bed now. I did not write down too much of today.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="january-29th">January 29th<a href="#january-29th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to January 29th" title="Direct link to January 29th">​</a></h3>
<p>The past couple days I&#x27;ve just been studying and working on homework. And excercising. I did not to anything too crazy, I mean on the 25th I for the very first time 3D printed something, it was my cell model that I made on the 10th. You can go check it out on the blog entry Jan 10th. Currently 5:00, I went to school, relaxed. Now I am going to study. Actully I will finish my project.</p>
<p>Now 6:00, I finished it! Weeks of hard work and I am done! It looks great, I am fixing grammer and some minor things here and there. It will make all the difference though. Side note; Today a person came to our school to talk about skilltrades, like cooking, welding, technicion, etc. He kept exaggerting about how we will make <strong>sooo</strong> much money doing them. Work life balance and etc, I want to be some sort of scientist that studies and researches about DNA and how to mess with it. Maybe I&#x27;ll even make a chimera when Im older. But now, I study. A trade sounds nice, but if your work is not your life, you dont like it? If you dont like it, find balance? Why not find a job you do like then devote everything to it. You might be succesful, you might not. The guy who was presenting today talked about his freind &quot;Micheal&quot;, he said Micheal got a univarsity degree in bio-chem. He now works at wendy&#x27;s because he could not find any job opportunities. It makes me think about the future, some want to be lawyers or docters. I dont know, Im intrested in the existence of life, there does not have to be a meaning for eveything. Anyways, back to work! I will do something or the other now.</p>
<p>Just checked, I have to write 10-15 scentenses in french, about an animated film. It is due in 3 days. (SIGH). I will do it after eating something. Currently 6:30, be back soon. Currently 7:00, ate my brothers sandwhich and I did not relax. I wrote some notes for my presentation. I should relax. But afterwards. After showing it to my dad, my presentation is like 30 minutes long if I talk. He told me that it is painfully slow, but very very cool. I should speed it up or something. Anyways, now I will relax.</p>

<p>Today, I went to school, came back. It is now 6:30. I spent time with my dad making paper board games to play in the evening. It was fun, I admit it took a while though. What should I do? Finish my french work first. Just finished it, it was surprisingly easy. I wrote 26 sentences, they were mostly short though. Studied, relaxed, bed. I also played board games and my dad won the game of &quot;Dino game&quot;. Anyways, next day.</p>

<p>Currently 6:00, I studied for my geology test tomorrow. I relaxed for a bit too. I am now studying for my math test which is also tomorrow. I have two tests tomorrow. So I need to study. By the way, today at school I presented my monologe in front of the whole class.</p>
<p>This is the monologue I spoke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever heard the phrase don’t blink? I grew up hearing that, but I never knew its true meaning until now. Don’t blink. It’s your first day of Kindergarten you’re in your brand-new shoes with a bright new backpack excited to make new friends. Don’t blink. Now all of a sudden you find yourself leaving elementary going into middle school. Just six more years and I can drive, you think. Don’t blink. You’re in high school now, and those friends from kindergarten are long gone. You don’t know who you are. But it’s okay. Just four more years and you’ll go off to college and leave behind this side of the world. Don’t blink. You get your driver’s license and suddenly it’s like a whole world has opened up. Don’t blink. You’re a college junior now, “hardest year yet” they say. Only a few months till you’re finally an adult. Don’t blink. It’s your first day of senior year and you still don’t know what it is you’re doing but you go with it anyway. One year left, you think. This is your chance. Don’t blink. Before you know it it’s the end of senior year. Tears stream down your face while you walk among the peers you’ve grown up with, and all of a sudden you realize…You blinked.</p>

<p>This was an amazing monologue, it really makes you think of another phrase. &quot;Be in the moment&quot;. I dont know, I thought it was a well writen monologue. If you want to check it out, I will link it.</p>

<p>These days Im not writing much in here, Im just studying or reading, or playing games. Did you know, I have not used my console in months? Me neither, but I play on my phone for the most part.</p>
<p>There is this one website that is called &quot;helpteaching&quot;. This is a good website, very surprisingly. Anyways, back to work.
