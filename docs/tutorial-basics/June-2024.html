<p>It&#x27;s now june! I&#x27;m almost in highschool, it went incrediblely fast, though that&#x27;s okay. I did not waste all my time, I was moderately productive.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="june-1st">June 1st<a href="#june-1st" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to June 1st" title="Direct link to June 1st">​</a></h3>
<p>I went to lynn canyion park, susoension birdge, then cleveland dam, afterwards we went to grandville island markart place area, we bought cookies, popinoes puffcream, and german sasuges. A seagull swooped and took the bread on top of mama&#x27;s puffcream (search it up). I got the toffe flaver, mama got the malteaser (to share with daddy), and my younger brother got the sprinkles one. We then left to go to the mall, ate lots of food. then we headed to airport, felt better because of medicone, 100% well, took the flight and headed to here, the plane ride did not faze me, I have cured my fear of flying, I&#x27;m still afraid of boats though.</p>

<p>The flight ended, was 5 hours, it felt super quick (I think I slept most of it). When I woke up I was tired, so then we headed back home (though it was raining), so we took the airport shuttle to take the car home.</p>

<p>Went to school, then played grounders and frisbee after school and the park by (behind) jean steckle. It was a lot of fun, had 3 friends with me, enoch, rasham, and hiro. They are my best friends in canada.</p>

<p>Spent some time thinking, keep walking, thats it.</p>

<p>Wrote some stuff yesterday, kinda just vented, but relised it&#x27;s not worth it. And that I can find peace in my thoughts. I&#x27;m very busy, making the 3D keychain for the grad, the slideshow for the grad, a french presentation, a project, another project, one more project, and homework, studying, exersicing, and relaxing. Though I don&#x27;t think I have time for relaxing, whatever. My parents say I&#x27;m too busy, but I kind of have to be, I have responsibilities. I&#x27;ll get back to work.</p>
<p>Currently 8:15, it suddenly, out of nowhere (clear sunny skies) started raining. It is raining really hard, like cats and dogs. I have gotten to the point in which I am happy with the book club movie trailer, I shall refine it a little.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="june-6th">June 6th<a href="#june-6th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to June 6th" title="Direct link to June 6th">​</a></h3>
<p>I showed my groupmates the finished product of the bookclub movie trailer thingy, it turned out really good. I also got the 3d keychain for grad done, we ended up using my design, so my job is now done for that. Two things done, just now I spent an hour working on the grad presentation. I only have not too many things to do left, I&#x27;ll exersice.</p>
<p>I just did 30 pushups in a row, that&#x27;s now my new record! It used to be 25, I&#x27;ve imporved, nice.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="june-7th">June 7th<a href="#june-7th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to June 7th" title="Direct link to June 7th">​</a></h3>
<p>I went to the conveincce store, and bought a 2 liter bottle of fanta. Honestly, all soda tasts the same, bad. It tastes like maple syrup, but spoiled. I bought it for the project I have, I&#x27;m tasked to create a water bottle rocket whithen 12 days. The prjoects just keep piling up, ha.</p>

<p>I ate some leftover KFC from the night prior, I feel a little sick, but my mind is clear. I have been sick for the past week, but I&#x27;ll be fine. Currently 4:44, and I am working on my passion project. Doing this has allowed me to learn many things about biology I would never had known unless doing this. I want the person that views my project to have a clear understand about everything related to evolution by the end of it. But how will I teach someone something I don&#x27;t even know? So I&#x27;ve been learning lot&#x27;s.</p>
<p>I relise now, if there is no one to depend on, you can depend on youself. But to depend on yourself, you need to become dependable. So if you are able to depend on yourself, you trust yourself. Which means other people can depend on and trust you? Modun tollens, trustworthy = people can trust you. Therefore not trust worthy = people cannot trust you. I dunno, whatever, back to work.</p>

<p>I went to get a haircut, I cut it more than 5 inches shorter. It used to be down to my shoulders, now it hangs past my eyes (and a little past ear, and for the back; it meats my shoulder). I got sweptback hair, I love it, it looks great. Only reason why I grew out my hair was becaus eI couldent decide on what hairstyle I wanted. I just asked my bareber to cut 2 inches off the back, (he cut more) nothing too fancy. After he did that, he used product to style my hair back, I looked like a different person.</p>

<p>Monday, went to school with my new cut. Some said I look like a man now, others said &quot;You used to look like a girl, a really buff one&quot;. I am thankful I have wide shoulders and a lean body (genetics, and a little exersice). I lost a lot of weight by just doing sports (yes), and exersicing. Sports is a great way to lose weight, just run around, you&#x27;ll lose wieght eventually. Anyways, relaxed a little. The weekend was my days off, I needed it. Usually I just study and do homework, but I decided to trest myself.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="june-11th">June 11th<a href="#june-11th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to June 11th" title="Direct link to June 11th">​</a></h3>
<p>I need to work on my projects, and chug a 2 liter of fanta (for my science project). If you have read &quot;June 7th&quot;, you know what I mean. I&#x27;ll get too it, just later. My mom said that we will drink it as a family, yeah. Back to work.</p>

<p>There was a 3-pointer competition at my school (basketball). The top 5 today will move on to the finals tomorrow. Aside from that, there was an event as my younger brothers school. It was like a faire, I went there, saw some friends, bought things, and left. It was from 4:30 to 7:30, I bought a brownie beavertail, poutine, and ginger ale. The food was so unhealthy, like on another leve. I will not eat such junk food for a while. Anyways, relaxing now.</p>

<p>I watched the finalie, it was cool. One of my friends got 2nd place, nice. The way you act determines how others view you.</p>

<p>Sunday, just worked on my passion project. I will present it soon.</p>

<p>Went to school, it was movie day. We watched shrek 1, it was cool. I also learned that I will be presenting my presentation tomorrow.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="june-18th">June 18th<a href="#june-18th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to June 18th" title="Direct link to June 18th">​</a></h3>
<p>Today, I presented my presentation. It went well, I got a 92% mark on my presentation. It is because I didn&#x27;t use proper capitilization, but that means that everything else went good. Anyways, later in the day we had tug-of-war class vs class. Other classes have people 6 ft tall and some classes have just big students. Each class got to choose 5 students from each class, to represent their class. In the end, the winner of the tournament, was my class!! Since I was on the tug-o-war team, I had practice pulling, so I won. I&#x27;m pretty happy about that, exersicing pays off, it really does. I&#x27;ve gotten first place in all the strength competetions the school has had while I&#x27;ve been here, this makes me feel good. But, I can still imporve. I&#x27;ll just study now, I havent studied in like a week. I&#x27;ve just been busy working on projects.</p>

<p>I came back from school, it&#x27;s getting warmer. Currently 6:47, I got up off my chair and did 30 pushups. It was no problem, easy in fact. I&#x27;m kidding, it was tough, and I don&#x27;t think my form was the best either. But this shows my progress, I used to be able to do 20, now I can do 30 without too much difficulty. Ten used to be hard, then twenty, then thirty, now I have some hope of getting 40 consecutive.</p>
<p>Anyways, currently 7:00. I recently bought a better handgripper. It goes up to 40 kg (88 punds), my last one was 10 kg. I turned it up to max, and can easily do 3 in a row. I&#x27;ve had it for a few days, so I tried to max it out. And it worked, I can do 3 maxes in a row. I just did 10 in a row, it only counts if the two grip&#x27;s touch. I&#x27;m pretty happy about that, this means I&#x27;ve gotten stronger, nice. It&#x27;s funny, 10 kg hand gripper used to be difficult. I used to not be able to do 10, but now I can do ten of four times the difficulty. I feel like there is a technique, you have to use your pinky too, to get the most force you can. I just did 5 more, but my fingers (pinky) hurts. So I&#x27;m gonna relax for a bit, I&#x27;m hungry.</p>

<p>After I was hungry, I ate 2 eggs. Anyways, today we had water day! It was a day where there were activities surrounding water. Like water duck duck goose, but the goose gets water poured on them. I also played a game where you need to catch the water ballon. I was soaking wet, drenched, hed to toe by the time it ended. When it ended, it was time to go home, so I walked home wet. Which was a good thing, because it was pretty warm, and the water cooled me down. My friend (who has less water), told me he felt like he was gonna get a heat stroke by how hot it was (it was warm at best). I have no cold tolerance, but high heat tolerance.</p>

<p>Just went to school, had fun, and then played rugby in gym class, it was a lot of fun.</p>

<p>(d(t^?))/(dt) = ?(t)^2</p>
<p>Something, idk derrivitives. Now polonomial long division, the polynomial remainder theorem.</p>
<p>( f(x) / x - a ) R = f(a)</p>
<p>The remainder of function x, divided by x minus the value of a, is equal to function a. This seems true, crazy. So if you just want the remainder, function &quot;a&quot; to find it, wow. So, now-a-days, I do not write much down. But I exersice every day, 30 pushups are starting to feel easier. I do squats, mess around with weights, and do back exersices. I also study, do homework, and relax. I just don&#x27;t write it down, because I could have spent that time writing it down actually studying. Though writing things down could further your understanding, doing actual problems works the same (though you may not have the same level of understanding). Soo.. quantity over quality I guess. Just do a bunch of problems, and try to understand why you got the answer, this is the middle ground in which I prefer. Just study, and understand.</p>

<p>I have furthered my unnderstanding of functions, turns out they are very simple, so simple it hurts that I ever thought they were hard. They just use the same principals of math, but visually and intuitively. It is complex, but it&#x27;s also simple, because after all it is a collection of numbers. Those wierd graphs with the asymbptotes, I thought, &quot;how are they possible?&quot; They are possible because the vertical asymptote is where the function &quot;f(x)&quot; becomes undifined, and goes into positive or negative infinity, depending on what the function is.</p>

<p>I studied a lot yesterday, and got to 76% on high school biology khan acedemy. Till I saw that there are two highschool biologyn courses, cool. Anyways, I thought I had a feild trip today, turns out I did not. But, this proffesinal competitive frisbee player came to our school, he one on one taught me some frisbee tricks for 15 minutes (it felt like forever). I learned some cool tactics on better-ing my throws. This guy threw the frisbee with such accurcy and power that my thumb is buised and purple. But I like it, because it&#x27;s a strange feeling, I havent been bruised in a long long time. Only cuts, and blood wounds, that and mild soreness. But a bruise feels different, like the flesh is crushed in that area.</p>
<p>Currently 8:00 exactly, I have reached 80% on the &quot;high school biology NGSS&quot;. I am pretty happy, Im making progress. I just listened to &quot;what once was&quot; by solare. I cried, very few songs make me cry, but that song was enlightning. Most of his songs are true art. Anyways, I&#x27;m just laying on the floor, thinking about how fast everything is going.</p>
<p>Now 8:15, I relise I&#x27;m wasting time, I&#x27;ve enjoyed my time hanging out with my friends, I wont be a little kid any more. I&#x27;m gonna become a highschooler, though I never feel like a little kid. I&#x27;m not mature enough, but that&#x27;ll come in time, everything will. I&#x27;ll just enjoy the remining time, and stop worrying about silly things, that&#x27;s the mature thing to do. After all, I don&#x27;t have time to be sentimental, change is a part of life afterall. Do I miss california, yes. But do I get caught up in nostalgia? No, because there&#x27;s no point, sure I&#x27;ve become who I am because of my past. But because I am who I am, I find it meaningless to dwell on what could have been. Rather, I would spend that time focusing on what could be, or who I would like to be. And I, I would like to become a great person, someone I look up to. A man worthy of my own admiration, it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve always wanted. And I think I&#x27;m amazing, but I think I could be better, which is why I strive to be. Anyways, 8:20, gonna relax.</p>
<p>Forgot to mention, but like 5:30 to like 6:00-ish I exersiced (I was very very tired afterwards).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="june-25th">June 25th<a href="#june-25th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to June 25th" title="Direct link to June 25th">​</a></h3>
<p>So, today I had my feild trip. We walked to a park, then played there for 2 hours. I thought it would be boring, but it was the most fun 2 hours of my life I&#x27;ve had to date. I had fun, and I look forward to more experiances like that. Instead of, &quot;I&#x27;d give anything to do that again!&quot; I believe that having more experiances like that will be fun. Ha, the park had spinny things, bouncy things, and more. I played badmintin, and played on playstructures and stuff. Now-a-days, I feel like I know everyone. After all, there are only 100 8th graders at my school. At my past school there were 300, and I knew more than 90% of them. Meeting people becomes easier each time you do it. Go out of your comfort zone, and live to become better. I talked to so many people, socilizing is a breeze. I am bragging, because I&#x27;m that proud of my abilities to talk. I&#x27;m proud of myself, I feel legendary. I feel like every day is another chapter in the epic story of my life. Because I make it epic, and you can (should) too. Just be a good person, and everything will come. A good person isn&#x27;t just nice to others, they are nice themselves. By this, I mean they take care of their health and welbeing. I don&#x27;t mean being esy on yourself, you need to hate yourself to love yourself. You need opposites for the other to be an opposite. You see, exersice, eat good, and other things, they are all good qualities. My teacher asked my classmate to be leader of a class game, they were pathetic, so much so I burned inside about how poorly they did it. I know I could have done a better job, they were rude, bad at being a leader, and everything. But I don&#x27;t always need to be a leader, supporting is an equally important job. I know I could have done better though, it hurts to see someone being so bad at something, when I could have done it for them. But that in itself is stupid, so my point of contention is just to be better. Be better, once your better, compare yourself endlessly till you lose your mind. Achieve perfection, then relise you were never perfect, wallow, then rise again. This takes a strong mind to do, and it helped me become a better version of myself.</p>
<p>As a human, you have rational thought, so would it not be rational to improve? Improvment is natural, and should be everyones goal in life. Wheather to improve your kids, your home, yourself, others, and your envirnmoent. I want to be the best, the greatest, the one of all ones. But to do that, you need to get better, and getting better takes and takes. I compare myself to everything, to the point my confidense is based in illusions. But, I have lots of confidence, why? Because I get better than the things I once was not. If your unhappy about something about yourself, try to fix it. No one is perfect, perfection is infinite. But we can strive to reach infinity, just as numbers do. I strive for perfection, because I need peace of mind. &quot;Am I the best? Am I better than that? Can I do that?&quot; To combat this, just say yes in your mind. Lie to yourself, &quot;yes I&#x27;m taller than that guy&quot;. But then after two seconds, &quot;well.. no I&#x27;m not taller than that guy, but it&#x27;s okay, I don&#x27;t need to be&quot;. Don&#x27;t delude yourself, but keep your sanity.</p>
<p>You know what, this does not apply to everyone, but this works for me. I find solace in myself, my thoughts, my actions. Be someone you admire, someone you trust, become a person you thinkn is great. Never be ashamed of yourself, because you should make sure not to do anything disgraceful. Act how you want to become, be who you want to be, become the man you wish you were. I have wished endelessly, &quot;I want social skills, I want endless friends, I want to be the best, I want to be better, why am I not better, please become a great man, I want to become someone great, I need to look up to myself.&quot; Look only up to youself, as only you can control what you do. You cannot control others, as you are you. So if you look up to yourself, you can be perfect, because you can create the perfect hero in your eyes. Yourself, so become who you think is great. I wanted to become a great man in the future, someone respectful, and respected. But you cannot just wait for all that to come, you need to start early. That wont ever come in time, till you become/start that in time. If I want to have a good body, why can&#x27;t I? I just need to become better, it&#x27;s easy.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t wait, start now. I wan&#x27;t to become a scientist, so I&#x27;m studying about the topics of my intrest. I cannot wake up 30 years in the future and become a scientist by luck. You have to want it, but pursue it. Wanting isn&#x27;t enough. I&#x27;m proud of myself, I&#x27;ve become my own role model, I aspire to be as great of a man as myself. So I keep trying to get better, to catch up to myself, and I&#x27;m a great man. So to catch up to a great man, you must become an even greater man, a better version of youself. So what if it&#x27;s a never ending loop, enjoy life? I enjoy seeing myself improve, I enjoy my perception of myself. As I am me, and I have to become better than myself. My consciense is alive, but this just means I have my own will, thus I have rational thought. I&#x27;m blessed to have such an abundunce of rational thoughts, as I relise to live life to the fullest, you need to make life the fullest. The only one who always keeps you company, is you, so become someone you can trust and love. Tell youself you can become better, because life is about change, and change is how life functions. Without change, nothing would exist.</p>
<p>Back to my point of contention, just be better, cry tears of blood, but get back up and become the man you&#x27;ve always wanted to be. If you&#x27;re a girl reading this, just be polite. The most attractive thing I find in a girl, is if they are soft-spoken, and polite. You can be ugly, but if you talk nice, you&#x27;re more attractive than if you weren&#x27;t. No one likes rude people, not even rude people themselves. As a man (or a boy), you need to be the one doing the heavy lifting. Girls can be strong, they can be leaders, they can be great. But if you&#x27;re unlucky enough to be in a group of girls who are.. what do I say? Do I say disgusting? Pathetic, useless, a burden? Yeah... if you&#x27;re unlucky enough to be in a group of girls who are a burden, just do it, whatever the take may be, just do it. So what if they don&#x27;t help? They get under your skin? It frustrates you how they are just so (something)!! Well tolarate it, and move on. Be the leader, lead the way. And to be a better leader, you must be a leader (you understand). I&#x27;ve met people who I&#x27;ve thought were disgraces to the human race, girls who I thought don&#x27;t have any reason to exist, guys who I&#x27;ve thought were pathetic and dirty. Some girls just act dirty, like bags of meat fleash and bones. Dirty means, like without grace (poise), shameful. The way people act determines a lot, expessially for girls. A guy can get away with it if they are strong enough in other area&#x27;s. But I don&#x27;t care how pretty you are, if you act without grace, you are disgusting. A basic sense of commons should be to act with dignity, rather even self esteeem prevents such stupidity, but selfevidently it&#x27;s careless to say everyone is good enough. No one is my eyes has ever been good enough, my classmates I&#x27;ve hated (but I act nice to their faces), I&#x27;ve grown to like them and bond with them. Sure, they are not good enough for my view, sure I believe they lack significantly in ways I care not to say. But people have flaws, if they can overcome it they will, if they cant-they wont.</p>
<p>This why you must look to yourself for everything, take on the world by yourself (depends). Have a problems, ask yourself, and if yourself tells you to ask someone else, do it. Be the perfect friend, family, person, existence, organism, creature, human. Only then I&#x27;d find warmth in my own being-in this reality of ours. The previous sentance could be inturrpretted in many ways, and to each their own way of inturpretation.</p>
<p>My time of speach has come to an end, as I have things to do. Talk with grandoise, be legendary, be epic. Be your own hero, then nothing could faze you. Even if everyone hates you, you can still count on your best friend. Yourself, so make youself as great as you can. So when the time comes-from hence you require support, and need to fall back, you have your great self to catch you. Anyways, I&#x27;m gonna get back to work.</p>
<p>So, currently 8:12, I went to the park with my family. My dad bet me $80 I coulden&#x27;t block his soccer kick, he kicked such a straight an easy to block shot. But when I kicked it, it rolled off my foot and went in the goal, damn. Anyways, then he decided to raise the stakes. The stakes were raised to; $500 if I blocked his shot, but if I blocked it, I had to do 1 task of his asking. I declined, as I do not need to money, what use do I have for $500? I have money, though it&#x27;s far less than $500, I have enough. I do not need $500, if I needed it, I would&#x27;ve took the bet. But my pride is worth more than $500, but was this ever a question of ego? No, no it wasnt, I simply do not need it. What kind of task would he ask of me? I would rather not take the chance, &quot;it can&#x27;t be that bad&quot;. Yeah, the task he could ask of me would probably be not bad, but I don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;m not taking the chance. Moreover I do not need the $500, even if it would be nice to have if such occasion rose that needed $500. But as of now, I simply do not need it, and why would I take $500 from my own father. He can keep it, I don&#x27;t need it.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m just studying a little, because relaxing is wasting time? No, I&#x27;m not sure, I need time to decide wheather relaxing is a waste of time or not. I&#x27;ve decided, but my way of relaxing is a waste of time. So what now? I don&#x27;t know, I could exersice. I&#x27;ll do that, yeah.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="june-26th">June 26th<a href="#june-26th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to June 26th" title="Direct link to June 26th">​</a></h3>
<p>Today was my graduation, I had fun, there was also a dance. I wore a nice shirt and pants, I looked good, my muscles were popping out, and my shoulders looked massive. I&#x27;m lucky I have good shoulder genetics, and work hard. I&#x27;ve become much stronger, moving on, it was fun. I was sweating so much my shirt got drenched, but it was worth it, as the dance was so much fun.</p>
<p>I worked on (solely made) the picture gallery that displayed memories from this year. And designed the 3D keychain that was passed out. I got the worst, bad looking 3d printed keychain. But this is a good thing, because if I get the only bad one, then everyone else will get good ones. Thus meaning; they&#x27;re happy, I&#x27;m happy, they won&#x27;t complain, I won&#x27;t complain. I made it for the school, not for myself, so getting the only bad one is a stroke of luck. Thank god, everyone else got good ones. That&#x27;s all I wanted, I don&#x27;t care about me getting one, as I made it for my peers (friends woulden&#x27;t be apporpreite).</p>
<p>Anyways, it qas raining after the dance was over, so I took the school bus for the first time ever. I gave my umbrella to my two friends who were wearing suits, because I decided not to bring mine. I got wet, but it made the sweat look like water. While on the bus, my friend showed me his finger. There was a long slice about an inch long running along his finger, there was lot&#x27;s of blood coming out. I told his it&#x27;s a small scratch, and to lick it, he wiped it off with a tissure. When we got off the bus, I told him he can&#x27;t act like that, as he has a younger sibling. He cannot show weakness, only absolute strength. Once we got off, his mom pulled up into the side of the road. She asked if we want a ride, my friend and I said yes. She dropped me off home, then I said bye. I went inside and then my parents, and younger brother, came out to surprise me. There was cake, muffins, and chicken on the counter. We then ate, and now I&#x27;m up here writing this.</p>
<p>Summer school starts on tuesday next week, which is July 2nd I&#x27;m sure. I decided to sign up for it, because I wasted last summer just sleeping all day long on my hamock back in california. You can&#x27;t blame me, the weather was too perfect to be stuck in doors. Anyways, summer school will be fun, this spesific summer school program is tailored to teaching us about ninth grade, before ninth grade. So it&#x27;s a reach ahead program, that seems to have merit.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m gonna do something now.</p>
<p>Now 10:30, I did a lot of things. I exersiced, then headed out to buy gifts for my teachers as tomorrow is the last day of school. And it is also my last day of being in 8th grade. I just need to write notes, yeah. After the dance, we all went home. They also passed out certificates, forgot to mention that.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="june-27th">June 27th<a href="#june-27th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to June 27th" title="Direct link to June 27th">​</a></h3>
<p>I gave my gifts to my teachers, they liked them. I put things that they&#x27;d like in gift bags, then gave it to them in person. It is 8:08 right now. Now 10:35, I have had a fun day. Today was the last day of school, and also my last day of being an 8th grader. I&#x27;ve made many memories at this school, and many friends too. It pains me to leave, but life must go on. I&#x27;m scared of whats to come? No, I must not be, as I am the eldest in my family. Change is part of life, it is inevitable, it is forever. I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be a little kid forever, but this feeling of moving on.. waves of sorrow crash along my back, it&#x27;s tides echo memories and times I had. I think I had more fun here in canada than I did in the U.S, kid&#x27;s here are nice, the overall feel is nice. I moved on from my other school, but I too had memories there. But the school I just left, Janet Metcalfe, I will never forget. Thank you for teaching me valuable lessons, and being a part of shaping me. This explainable feeling, this tangible sense of melecholoy and nostalgia, I know it serves me no pourpose. Or does it? How can I forget, I can&#x27;t. Isntead of forgeting, I shall move on with pride and joy, as the fun times I had will be cherished by me. If I knew it would go by this fast, would I have enoyed it more? No, the way I lead my life at school was the best I could have done, I would not change a thing. It is my mistakes, and acheivemtns, that created my experiance.</p>
<p>I won&#x27;t see them again, I&#x27;ll never see his face, or hers. I&#x27;ll miss them, the times we had with no worries, just goofing off. I loved it, every moment of 8th grade. School is important, everyone should go to school. The life skills you learn outshine any sort of acedemic pourpose. I&#x27;m thankful, and I&#x27;m also happy. Wallowing in rememberance serves me no good, but recalling my times, and moving forward with the intent to make more such memories serves me good-if not great. Here in canada, I felt like a kid again, I felt free. I felt safe, but this was bound to end. Warmth alone cannot carry you through winter, you need to be risistant to the cold, or get used to it.</p>
<p>Haaa, sigh, well screw it. I&#x27;ve had so much fun, and made so many memories, so there is no reason to taint them with sad vibes. I should associate those times with happiness and joy, not nostalgia. I shall move on, as highschool is an important and exciting time in my life. I will be starting summer school soon, I think I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, next tuesday. I had fun in the snow, so much fun in the snow. I&#x27;ve had fun in the spring, fall, summer, and winter. So what if I never see them again! They live on in my memories, it&#x27;s not like they died, I just won&#x27;t see them again. But I hold our memories, and that in itself is enough. I respect their existances, and they respected my own. I won&#x27;t forget them, nor the amazing times we had in class.</p>
<p>Canada teaches differently, and I love it! But I do believe the U.S&#x27;s way of teaching is also crucial to development (of kids). I&#x27;ve watched myself grow, I&#x27;ve relised my thoughts, and have tried to find out why I think of such thought. Or why I have such feelings, like now. Why am I sad? I&#x27;m not, I&#x27;m just gonna miss them, their existances. Be it rain or shine, those days, I&#x27;ll miss. But I won&#x27;t just miss them, I&#x27;ll learn from them, as It&#x27;d be a waste to wallow. Just enjoy the time.</p>
<p>I just talked with my dad about how different the U.S and canada is. I strongly believe that being a nice person will never let you down. Good guys do finish last, in the race to ruin. And life isn&#x27;t a race, or even if it were, you need not take the same race as a bad person. Be a good person, and you will be the best you, you can be. I&#x27;ve made the most of my time, because I adapt, because everyone likes good people. And if good guys finish last in a race, that&#x27;s not the type of race you wan&#x27;t to be in. Be the support character, be the leader, be the best person ever. Just do it.</p>

<p>I have a four day weekend, today is the 1st day. What&#x27;ll I do today? Maybe buy presents for my friends birthday party on saturday. I exersiced as soon (20 minutes after) as I woke up, because I woke up feeling not good. I will just do some khanacedemy, then something else.</p>
<p>Y&#x27;know, meating people and socializing is my favorite thing to do. That feeling when you connect with someone, and have a good time just talking. You feel like your floating, this happens when you&#x27;re nice, and they follow along. I love school, it&#x27;s so much fun. Yesterday, while walking home I met a guy who I&#x27;ve barely talked to in the school year. I talked with him, he seemed like a guinenly nice guy. My heart sinks when I think of all that could&#x27;ve been, but then I relise all that wouldn&#x27;t have beem, then I&#x27;m thankful for what I&#x27;ve experianced. Humans are social creatures, talking heals, exersicing strentghes. It heavily matters who you talk to, I talk to myself (whom I consider to be a high quality human). So find some great human to connect to, to become great. That, or become great youself. Hardships, loss, gain, they are needed to grow. You need harshness, but need warmth. You need both to become the best version of yourself. Max out your socializing skill, it will change everything.</p>
<p>Ahmed, a black man from my school with the best afro I&#x27;ve ever seen. He has a twin, but he&#x27;s the more handsome one (with better hair), and talks with grace. What I mean, is he seemed to be a good quality of human, a good person. And by talking with grace, I mean he doesn&#x27;t do much to embaress himself or others, he talks kindly, agreeably and politly. This is how people should talk. with dignity and politness. I try to be nice, as much as I can. If I don&#x27;t wanna know someone, I won&#x27;t know them unless circumstances has it that way. Connecting with people is easy, as long as you both are agreeable. You need to asses, if they are worth having as a friend, or if you even want to know them. Rude people hold no place in my heart, but sometimes rude people can have good hearts.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve learned from experiance, to make as many friends as you want, but to relise who is good (person/quality). The best humans, in my opinion, are the ones who have charisma. What is charisma; is can be founded by your way of speach, act, actions, and look. Talk like your the best person (angelic) in the world. Act with dignity, you need to perserve your honor. And do good actions, make people respect you. Don&#x27;t look dumb, just don&#x27;t make weird faces. Smile, be expressive, remember, your an adult. This is what I think in my head. No one cares about what you&#x27;re saying, they just want to be heard, and for people to listen. They do not wan&#x27;t responses in most cases. Like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over the weekend I went to the spa with my family</li>
<li><em>Ah, that&#x27;s pretty cool</em> -Smile</li>
<li>Yeah, it was fun, and the water was warm</li>
<li><em>Like was it too hot?</em> -plain face</li>
<li>Huh? Oh nah, I could handle it</li>
<li><em>Nice, what else did you do over the weekend</em> -showing intrest</li>
<li>Ah I just relaxed, and played video games</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a casual conversation with a pure-hearted 8th grader. This is a polite conversation, where the italisized person listens. You must give intrest, to get intrest from other&#x27;s. A rude convo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey bro this weekend I-</li>
<li>Who?</li>
<li>Me-</li>
<li>Asked!</li>
<li>What?</li>
<li>I&#x27;m just joking</li>
<li>Okay..</li>
</ul>
<p>Another:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey man, how&#x27;s it going</li>
<li>Who are you?</li>
<li>. . .</li>
<li>I&#x27;m kidding</li>
<li>Alrigh-</li>
<li>Sike</li>
<li>Deep breath, I went to a spa-</li>
<li>Did I ask?</li>
</ul>
<p>No one will respect you if you don&#x27;t resppect other&#x27;s. The only thing that can teach you these things are life, and experiance. You need to meat as many people as you can, be social, meat existances. Compare your own to theirs, don&#x27;t like that they are better than you? Relise your shortcomings, then work on them. Meet more people, take traits that you like. They talk polite, and other&#x27;s like them? Follow that, and talk politly too. Somone exersices and people like them because they are strong? Then you yourself become strong. They smoke, and other&#x27;s follow them and they are popular. Do not follow them, I once almost feel into it. Just becuase every other person at school smokes, does not mean you should. Just cause they do it, does not mean you should. I was young and dumb back then, but after 2 more years of life, I relise life is more than being popular. Popularity will come, but first learn. You be a student before a master, then a master before you teach. I spent years looking up to bad people, good people, desiring to be like them. But now I&#x27;m at the top, I have their skills, and more. I&#x27;m left at the tip of the mountain, looking to the sky, and the bigger mountain I need to reach. There are more than one mountains, thus more than one peak. Once you reach the top, climb down, then climb up even higher.</p>
<p>You can ignore this, it is random:
How do you go into NPC mode? Just let your mind have the reins, make simple choices, and have simple responses. Just watch youself from your own eyes, and listen to yourself as you speak. It&#x27;s an out-of-body experiance, it&#x27;s crazy. Just let your mind take over, and talk. I once watched my hands move, and my mouth speak, but all that while I was observing myself doing this. It feels like... I can&#x27;t describe it. It&#x27;s incredible though, not because it feels good, but becuase you find youself mvoing while observing.</p>
<p>The best test subject is yourself, your thoughts and actions. I have watched my self grow up, I&#x27;ve improved, every year. I&#x27;ve become a better man than I used to be. Exersicing is a good way of testing your limits, so is socializing. I&#x27;ve been in many tense situations, all in the U.S. I&#x27;ve been through situations where quick thinking is crucial, where one wrong move and your on the ground. Challenge, promotes imporvment. Humans are amazing, we can evolve without evolution, and endless deaths. Our brains, and rational abilities are.. profound.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&#x27;ll get back to work.</p>
<p>Aparently, there are 20,000,121,091,000,000,000 plants and animals on earth. I do not know if this considers other organisms, but this is a lot.</p>
<p>Currently ???, I ate breakfeast (apple pie), and got to 91% on khanacedemy High school biology - NGSS. I&#x27;m pretty happy about that.</p>
<p>Currently 7:13, what&#x27;s wrong with me? I&#x27;ve been feeling unhappy so often lately, like depressed. If somone does not talk polite, or act perfectly, it makes me mad. Everyone has flaws that they need to fix, but this doesn&#x27;t mean they have to act perfectly. But curtesy is important, the way people talk is important. I love talking to myself, I can have a perfect conversation, with perfect speach.</p>
<p>Currently 30 minutes later, it&#x27;s so easy to talk to kids my own age. Just vented out my thoughts, but 3 hours later relised it&#x27;s not worth it. No point, just let it be.</p>
<p>Anyways, now 10:10, I&#x27;m at:</p>

<p>I will go brush now, I&#x27;m tired.</p>

<p>Bought gifts for me friend, 6 bars of chocolate, a hand gripper, and uno. I then went to Tims, had a donut and timbits. Met up with my friend, it was his birthday. There were 5 friends there (including me). Then just hung around teh park with one friend, after the others left. Then I went to his birthday party, it was in a bowling alley. It was fun, there was an arcade.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m just relaxing.</p>
<p>&quot;If humans crawled on their elbows for generations, would natural selection give humans elbow caps? Just like knee caps?&quot;</p>
<p>Bro, it&#x27;s luck. If the only way to survive for humans, is by having elbow caps, then yes. Natural selection is natural because only the ones who survive pass on their genes. So if chance has it, and over time the ones with elbow protection survive more often than those without protection, then maybe after generations we could have elbow caps. That is if luck has it &quot;we&quot; evolve and have an elbow cap. So no, natural selection would not give us elbow caps if enough generations crawled on their elbows. But it could be possible in certain environments. I suggest learning on how evolution happens, it will open up your mind.</p>
<p>So how could we gain elbow caps? Supposedly by gene editing, or by forcing mutation with gene altering thing, or by subjecting humans to experiments in different environments to see which ones over time evolve into &quot;elbow cap having humans&quot;. When a group of a species is isolated, it &quot;adapts&quot; to its environment through the death and birth of many of it&#x27;s kind. Till one of it&#x27;s kind devolops (has) a trait that let&#x27;s it have a higher chance of survival. If we were to set the experiments setting to be one where the test subject species would need elbow caps to survive, we could force an evolution through natural processes.</p>
<p>Though, I mean, back to your original question. If the only thing humans knew how to do (for mobility), was to crawl on their elbows, then yes. As I said, if the only way of movement we had was to crawl on our elbows, we would be dead if we couldn&#x27;t move (crawl on our elbows). This situation could be a death sentence in a hostile environment, so to combat this, you must be able to crawl on your elbows (move). If you can&#x27;t, you die, and if you can you survive you pass on genes. The ones who survive reproduce and pass on their genes, which would make people with the ability to elbow crawl more common, as the ones who couldn&#x27;t elbow crawled died out, leaving less of those type of people. And if we take this a step further, by making the environment have a harsh terrain, we could &quot;force&quot; them to evolve in a way that solves the need for protection of the elbow while crawling on the rough ground. So, they would die if their elbows broke while crawling, as they would get caught by predators. So to combat this, they must pray that someone is born with an elbow protecting trait such as the elbow cap. If such an event happens, the one with the elbow cap trait would have a higher chance of survival, meaning it would reproduce more often than the ones without the trait. Leading to the population of elbow cap having humans increase.</p>
<p>So in a way, yes, it is possible. I do think that nature is cruel though, only the ones who survive pass on their genes. To survive you must be lucky enough to be born with an advantageous trait, or you are destined to perish.</p>

<p>It&#x27;s funny, an hour before grad on grad day, my teacher asked me to add a change to the memories slideshow-video-presentation. It was super last minute, but I got it done in time, it took about 40 minutes of running around and trying to get it done. But I persevered and got it finshed in time for the ceremony. The video was playing in front of all the parents, it was 15 minutes long. I also designed the 3D keychain they gave out inside the envolope they gave every student. So they handed everyone a envolope with a certificate, and the 3D kaychain I designed. They cheaped out and didn&#x27;t put any candy though, well never mind, we don&#x27;t need candy.</p>
<p>I am just laying on the floor right now, I weigh 163 pounds. Not bad, and it&#x27;s all muscle (I hope). When I look in the mirror, it looks like I&#x27;m buff, which is really cool. All those months of work paid off, I am not skinny, but buff.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a
