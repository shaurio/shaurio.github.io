<p>Hello! It is march already, Feb went by in a blink of an eye. It went by really fast, I mean one day it&#x27;s Feb 1st, the next its March 1st. Anyways, I will continue my day.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-1st-">March 1st 🚘<a href="#march-1st-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 1st 🚘" title="Direct link to March 1st 🚘">​</a></h3>
<p>I am going on a trip with my family, currently 6:56, I will be back at like lunch.</p>
<p>Currently 12:50, I am back. I drove for 1 and a half hours to some place, then spent some time at McDonalds. The food was phenomenal, the quality was <strong>surprisingly</strong> very good. In California, the McDonalds tastes like plastic, here tastes very nice. Anyways, I have a &quot;day off&quot; so I&#x27;m gonna study. Why not? While I was in the downtown area of Kitchner, I saw many homeless people. I also heard cries and screams coming from their camps, I felt terrible for them. But if I don&#x27;t want to end up like them, I need to put everything on the line and work hard. Doing that is hard, I get distracted but the only reason I keep going, is so I can brag about the stuff I did here. It gives me a reason to do things brag worthy, like studying for hours is something not everyone does. Although many, and I mean <strong>many</strong> people study for hours, it is still seen as a flex in my eyes. Playing games for hours is not a flex, it is concerning. Anyways, back to work.</p>
<p>Currently 1:00, I... <em>thinking</em>, don&#x27;t know how ten minutes passed by. That was quick, what was I even doing? Back to work I guess. I am currently studying english, why? Because I feel like it, so:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr34-c3da1c193de8aae0aec715718fc35b0a.png" width="1600" height="854" class="img_ev3q"> <em>Screenshot of something I made in google slides</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are three friends who counted the amount of clothes they each have. They decided to make a graph to represent the data, after making the graph Jeff was sad. He had ______ of the amount of clothes Mike had. Don told him to cheer up, after all, he had nice clothes. The three friends decided to go to a restaurant, Mike ended up paying, he had the most money. Jeff enjoyed the food, so did Don. Mike told his friends that though he had many clothes, he only wore around 5 of them regularly. They each parted ways and said their goodbyes, Don was happy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Answer the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What goes into the Blank?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Like less than half</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Around more than double</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Even more than triple</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>More than ten times</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So, what did you pick? I picked number 1, why? Because Jeff had less than Mike in terms of clothes. That means 2, 3, and 4 can not be the answer. Thus meaning one is the correct answer. You can eliminate and continue, or use the context of the text. The graph clearly shows that Mike had double the amount of clothes, while the #1 is not entirely true, as Jeff does not have less than half the amount of clothes as Mike. It still fits the text best, as in it is a better fit than the other answers. Get it? Anyways, I will continue. Currently 1:30. Today Is friday, the weekend is tomorrow, wow.</p>
<p>Currently 1:40, I spent ten minutes looking at all the things I&#x27;ve made in google slides (that I&#x27;ve put in here Ex: Diagrams/graphs/etc). I made quite a lot. Did some unfisnished math work, and relised I have some homework, I shall get to it. I found out I have like 10 plus assignments due in one of my classes, I have stuff to do. :(</p>
<p>Our teacher gave us a writing prompt, this was my answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot; If I was planning on moving to a deserted island, the three things I would bring are things I 100% need. The three things that are absolutely needed, are a food source, a source of water, and shelter. For food, I would bring a Set of 43 Assorted Vegetable &amp; Herb Seeds from amazon to grow. I would then bring a ton of P&amp;G water purifier, and the container would be an electric stove that charges using solar power. The third and final object would be a person, I would bring another person here with me. Yup. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why am I putting this here? I dont know, I just felt like it.</p>
<p>The second writing prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot; If I could go to starbucks with any celebrity, I would go with Guido Kroemer. He is a biologist with money, maybe he could teach me a thing or two. I am interested in that field so having someone to sponsor me in college or research would be nice. I would love to uncover more about DNA, how to cure cancer, and more. It interests me, I could have picked bill gates or something. But I did not, because I want knowledge, not endless wealth. It is true I want wealth, but not at the expenses of knowledge. I want to know about the universe and what makes it. So why pick someone who only has money to give, why not pick someone with money and knowledge (in my intrests). Plus, I think he would say yes, I hope. That is who I would like to go to starbucks with. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was my honest opinion, I want money, but also knowledge. I bet he knows all about cells, DNA, and etc. But anyways, I will get back to work. And if I chose someone like Elon musk or someone <strong>incredibly</strong> famous, it would only burden me. Currently 2:30, I will take a break.</p>
<p>Took a break, currently 4:30, it was a long break. I played minecraft with my younger brother, for a while. I built a house, my brother tried breaking it. I killed him (in game), then he killed me. This repeated and he blames me, we both lost all our XP. He now wants me to go outside and play with him, I don&#x27;t wanna. Should I go? Yes, I should. He doesn&#x27;t know anything, so I should teach him how to play soccer.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m conflicted, not thoughts, but emotion. What do I do? What do I want? Why do I want what I want? What is it that I want? I don&#x27;t want to play with him, why? He will do something and I&#x27;ll get mad, why? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get mad. I want to play with him but I&#x27;m conficted, why?</p>
<p>Whatever, I&#x27;m going. Currently 5:50, the grass was muddy so we played in the parking lot. There were many cars, but we did not get run over. I taught him how to do sidways shuffling and kicking with the inside and outside of your foot. I will play monopoly with my family, after eating and washing my hands.</p>
<p>Did not play monopoly, I played minecraft with my younger brother. I then exersiced for 30 minutes. It is currently 7:20, I will take a SAT reading an writing practice test. Not timed, but I&#x27;ll see how much I can get. Wish me luck.</p>
<p>Finished at 7:57, I will now check my answers. I took my time and yet took 37 minutes, dang it. Anyways I will check my answers. I got 25/33, so like 76%. It is better than last time, but not great. This is like a 420, is that good? Eh, I will show my dad. He said good, and that I should take the full SAT practice test sometime. I am currently in 8th grade, in ninth I hope to get a perfect score. I hope to do good, anyways. I will do some homework or something. Currently 8:10. I&#x27;m currently researching Nova Scotia for homework. I have to find out everything about it. Geographical Area, Resources, and Important People from Nova Scotia. It should take a few days, or a couple hours if done effectively. If I&#x27;m complaining about homework in 8th grade, imagine when I&#x27;m in 9th grade taking 10th spanish and 10th computer engineering. I will be full of stuff to do, but it will be rewarding, I will also try to do summer courses. Just for fun. <!-- -->:D</p>
<p>Anyways, I will go eat dinner. Currently 9:34, I finished dinner. I ate bread, soup, and chicken wings. The bread was a baguette, it was tasty. The soup was dal with spinich, and the chicken wings were sour. The chicken wings were BBQ flavored so they tasted kinda funny, my family did not like them. I thought they tasted alright. My stomach seems to disagree though, yep. Anyways, I will brush, relax, then <strong>try</strong> to sleep.</p>
<p>I cannot brush, my toothbrush is in my bathroom. The bathroom is locked. SIGH, I have so much chicken stuck in my teeth. I don&#x27;t want to use my nails because, 1. they arent sharp enough 2. I dont wanna 3. Why would I? I will just relax till the bathroom gets unlocked.</p>
<p><em>Currently the next day, I brushed then slept.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-2nd-">March 2nd 🌁<a href="#march-2nd-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 2nd 🌁" title="Direct link to March 2nd 🌁">​</a></h3>
<p>I had a good nights rest, for the first time in weeks I was able to sleep properly. It is a strange feeling being able to wake up rested, but anyways. I woke up at 6:50, played minecraft till 8:00. It is now 8:30, I am brushing while writing this, I will eat pancakes. Yup.</p>
<p>Currently 9:15, I ate breakfeast and watched Tv. The pancakes were blueberry ones, they tasted good. Now I will, <em>5 minutes later...</em> homework.</p>

<p>I will now research Nova Scotia (sko-she-ah) for homework. It is also called new Scotland, so some call it Scotia (ska-tea-ah). I don&#x27;t know which is right, but anyways, back to work. The fog has picked up, I will change the weather report. Currently 9:56, I am getting good progress done. The fog is so foggy the fog is not even visible. I can barely see 10 feet in front of me.</p>
<p>Currently looks like:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr35-535370f36dbfb3ecaa93845df110dfe9.png" width="1248" height="808" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>Screenshot of something I made in Canva, I have the Canva Pro.</em></p>
<p>I will fill it with info and stuff, it looks nice, but this is not what my teacher wants. Info, not art. Currently 10:40, where did the time go? An hour passed like * <strong><strong>snap</strong></strong> * that. This is what I have now:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr36-5c2217bf1a7fafb050c735dce23e4ee7.png" width="1248" height="808" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>An update of something I made in Canva</em></p>
<p>Why put this here? So I can see my own progress, no one else has to see. It&#x27;s fun too, just writing anything. Like a diary but not, anyways. I will take a break. It looks alright, not great. Currently 11:30, I excersied, I am tired. I will take a bath then eat food. Currently 11:48, I will eat something. An apple and two oranges. Currently 12:30-ish, I wasted time and just relaxed. My mother made sweet rolls, bread with butter and sugger wrapped up into a roll. Like a cinnimon roll, but with suger and butter. It was delicious, and not too sweet. I will study now, math.</p>
<p>I spent some time studying math, some graph stuff. And then talked to my Great Grandma on the phone, and also my grandparents. She could talk, hear, and she was very happy. I am lucky I can talk with my great grandparent. It is surreal, someone so old, yet blood related. She is someone who created a big part of the family tree, she is my grandpa&#x27;s mom, my grandpa is my dads dad, and my dad is my dad. And I am my dads son, its amazing really. But anyways, I will eat lunch. Currently 1:31.</p>
<p>It is now 3:23, I ate lunch, then exersiced for a bit (I dont know like 15-20 minutes) and then relaxed. I don&#x27;t know how long, but probably for 15-20 minutes I relaxed. I do not regret it as I learned something new. Anyways, I will now do some homework. I&#x27;ll just work on the project.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr37-614b87aebc4ec52f00f84fc081c4fea4.png" width="1248" height="808" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>Screenshot of my progress on the project</em></p>
<p>I think this is good, I dont want to waste time so I believe it looks nice. Finally, it looks nice. Currently 4:20, I feel good, it is relaxing doing homework or studying. It puts my nerves at peace, why? Because I don&#x27;t feel regret as much as I do when I waste time. Why regret when you dont have to, why not do things that aren&#x27;t regretful. Currently 5:15, I spent some time fighting my brother. It was fun, but my hair kept getting in the way, I am a man who likes keeping his hair long. It looks like a lions mane. But anyways, I will play minecraft of something.</p>
<p>Currently 6:30, I played minecraft. I will relax a little more then study. Currently 7:00, I just wanted time. I turned in my Nova Scotia assignment, it is finished. I am happy with it, I also fixed the typos and other things. I would&#x27;nt turn in  half completed project. Anyways, I will study.</p>
<p>Just read about linear and exponential relationship. Linear is where the increase is proportial or the same as last time, it is linear. Exponential is where the value exponetially increases, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jake wants to double his pencil amount every month. But he does not know how to represent it, he goes to ask a friend.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Answer the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You are the friend, find a way to represent the amount if Jake starts with 10 pencils</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer should be an equation/function (1 * (2/3 ^t) or f(x) = x * (2/3 ^t )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, what does this even mean? Jake wants to double his pencil amount every month, okay. So this guy wants to double (x2) the amount of pencils he has every month. But he does not know how to represent it, so he goes to ask a friend (us). Alright, this is how I would represent it:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 * 2^t</li>
</ul>
<p>Why? Because he starts with 10 pencils, and he wants to double them, so &quot; * 2 &quot;. And he wants to do it each month, so the amount of pencils would <strong>exponentially</strong> increase every month. So it would look like if &quot; t &quot;/# of months is three:</p>
<ul>
<li>f(3) = 10 * 2^t</li>
<li>f(3) = 10 * 2^3</li>
<li>f(3) = 10 * (2<em>2</em>2)</li>
<li>f(3) = 10 * 8</li>
<li>f(3) = 80</li>
</ul>
<p>In three months he would have 80 pencils, is this correct? Yep, pretty much. So 10 becomes 20 on month one because 10 * 2 is = 20. And then at two months it would be 20 doubled which would be 40. At three months, 80. At four months 160, and so on. Get it? I did not mean to make it into a function, it was just easier to represent if I did. This solved the question, nice. Anyways, I will continue to study. I will make a graph to show how it increases.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr38-da9b96cfc72f624cc91e9f0669decf8c.png" width="1278" height="928" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>Something I made in google slides</em></p>
<p>It shows f(5), everything up to the fifth month. See how it exponentially increases? A linear equation however would be simple, very simple. It is just repetitive in the sense of number scaling (non-exponential wise). Like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kate wants to buy 5 pencils every month. But she does not know how to represent it, she goes to ask a friend.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Answer the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You are the friend, find a way to represent the amount if Kate starts with 10 pencils</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer should be an equation/function (1 * 1(1) or f(x) = x * (1/1 *t )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does this mean? It just means kate wants to buy 5 pencils every month, so add 5. And she does not know how to represent it. Lets see:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 + 5(t)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is how I would write it, you can flip it and do:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 + t(5)</li>
</ul>
<p>Or:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 + (5 * t)</li>
</ul>
<p>But it just means the same thing, answer wise. So if we put in say 3 months, it would look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>f(3) = 10 + 5(t)</li>
<li>f(3) = 10 + 5(3)</li>
<li>f(3) = 10 + 15</li>
<li>f(3) = 25</li>
</ul>
<p>Now to show it in graph form:</p>

<p><em>Screenshot of something I made in google slides</em></p>
<p>See how it changes by the same amount each time? (not proportionate to any changing variable)</p>

<p>Currently exactly 7:00, I woke up at 6:50, just like yesterday. I got a sub-par sleep, why? My brother kept kept me up all night long. I will relax for a bit, then study. Currently 8:00, I just relaxed. I do not regret it, I learned something new. Anyways, I will study.</p>

<p>Currently 8:30, I wrote some more in the dev log. It took some time but it&#x27;s worth it, plus it is a good way to see my changes in the site over time. This is what it looks like now:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr40-72e79d3967879b981e6d247ab5c3f503.png" width="2878" height="1348" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>Screenshot of this Website at 8:24 AM, it is a sunday.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, it looks nice, but I will make it better. I will go check up on my family. Currently 9:30, how did we get here? I checked on my parents, they were sleeping so I woke them up (like a good son). And then I saw my brother playin games, he had been playing minecraft since 7:00. It was 8:30-ish when I caught him, he had been playing for a while. I then decided to play fight him and throw him around. It was fun, till I scratched him on accident, there was a mark on his face. It was a small scratch so he will be fine. But anyways, I will study.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr41-5e62832520b4170f39f79f86ed67a04b.png" width="1246" height="926" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>Screenshot of <strong>fixed</strong> version of something I made in google slides yesterday.</em></p>
<p>This is just the fixed ver of what I was showing yesterday. And YES, that is indeed a trend line. So in 1.5 months she would have 17-ish pencils. That is if the increase is not monthly, but dependent on making it double by next month. I am not sure what I just said, but get it? I will continue to study.</p>
<table><thead><tr> <th>x</th> <th>1</th> <th>2</th> <th>3</th> <th>4</th> <th>5</th> <th>6</th> <th>7</th> <th>8</th> </tr><tr> <th>y</th> <th>3</th> <th>6</th> <th>9</th> <th>12</th> <th>15</th> <th>18</th> <th>21</th> <th>24</th> </tr></thead></table>
<p>Currently 10:00, I did not waste time, or study. I just spent some time figuring out how to make tables in here. It was actually very simple, I did not use any videos or &quot;how 2&#x27;s&quot;. I just figured it out myself, nice. Anyways:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Answer the following using the table shown above:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the relationship between x and y? ( x : y or &quot;for every ? in x there is ? in y&quot;)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the increase linear or exponential? (it is ___)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does this mean? Thanks to my amazing table, we have the data we need to solve this. What is the relationship between x and y? My thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>For every 1 in x, there is 3 in y</li>
<li>1 : 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Is the increase linear or exponential. So every +1 to x is +3 to y. So yes it is, and if we want to further check, we can make a graph.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr42-9c1fedf7c939ee9a0285b0b3a2952947.png" width="1682" height="790" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>Screenshot of something I made in google slides that pretains to the table above.</em></p>
<p>Spent 15 minutes making the graph, it was not a waste of time? I furthered my understanding of graphs and how to make them. And yes you guessed it, it is a trend line. What is a trend line? It a line used to predict points on the graph by having half the points on the graph above and half of them below the trend line. So basically, the trend line is in the center, it is to make predictions and stuff. I also found out that the longer the screenshot, the smaller it is. So that is why squarish images/screenshots are huge. And longer ones aren&#x27;t as big.</p>
<p>ANYWAYS, currently 10:30, look at how much I&#x27;ve done! It is still morning but I&#x27;ve done so much already, nice. This, this is called being productive-ish. I like seeing how much I&#x27;ve done in a day. I studied, relaxed, and did some other things (I dont know what other things I&#x27;ve done besides eating, relaxing, and studying today). Breathing air? Anyways, I will take a break.</p>
<p>Currently 11:40, I took a break and played minecraft for an hour. I will now exersice. Currently 12:00, I exercised for a little bit. I will now continue exercising. Never mind I will eat lunch. Ate lunch, will now head to a park with my fsmily. Currently 1:00-ish.</p>
<p>I am back from the park, it is now 2:55. Close to three, anyways. I went to the park with my family, it was fun and I played soccer and frisbee with my family. My younger brother cannot throw a frisbee. While leaving the park, I saw some of my school mates hoping over a fence in the park. It was funny because they were struggling, they could have just walked to the entrance but I guess it was more fun to do that. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m innocent of hoping fences, it is fun but honestly not worth it. Anyways, I will exersice (incline pushups). Currently 3:03, I was spacing out, now I will exersice-ish.</p>
<p>I just did 20 pushups, my form was probably sub-par. But I did them, and I could only do 10 without stopping. I used to only do like 3, I am improving, but I need to improve more. I will now go do incline pushups (3:09).</p>
<p>I wasted like 30 minutes, and I regret it. I then spent around one hour exersicing (incline pushups). Currently 4:50. Do some quick math to find out how long I took exersicing. Hint: Read the paragraph again.</p>
<p>Anyways, with my weekend, day, and apple almost done. I can confidently say I am... _Ten minutes later. Hold up, let me think, am I ready for tomorrow? I will imagine thousands of scenarios in my head, so I am prepared for tomorrow.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do I wear?</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently 5:12, I just drank a glass of milk... that had whipped cream on it. It was really tasty, like really good. Anyways, after all that, I still have no clue what I&#x27;m gonna wear tomorrow. Eureka! I&#x27;ve got it, I&#x27;m gonna wear jeans, a black tee, socks, shoes, and a jean jacket. All the jean stuff are levi&#x27;s. I will look very cool. Well back to work I guess.</p>
<p>I have french homework, dang it, it&#x27;s due in <del>three</del> two days. I finished, it was rather simple, all I needed to do is write a letter in french. It was about a song, weather you like it or not, explain in french. What now? Currently 5:42. Just listened to a song (completly unrelated from the french assignment). It was about &quot;the days are the perfect length, but the years are too short for my soul&quot;, or something like that. The song itself was amazing. It is called &quot;Overcompensate&quot;, but anyways, back to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do I do tomorrow?</li>
</ul>
<p>I will walk to school, then talk to some friends before class starts. I will go to (day 4), art class in the morning. Nice, I like art it is fun. It is 5:55, I will study. Just saw some stuff about relationships is table&#x27;s x,y and stuff. Here is a question:</p>
<p>Alright, currently 7:30, I am back. I exersiced for like an hour, then watched tv for 30 minutes. Back to work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frank wants to eat 212 apples in 4 months. He knows that this is a hard task but also knows it is good for him. This man want&#x27;s to know how many apples to eat each month. And the total amount of apples eaten each month up to a certain month for every month. He want&#x27;s to know all this so that he can identify if he is running late in any apple eatings. He wonders who to ask. He walks over to a gas-staion near his house to ask a passerby this problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Answer the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>You are the passerby, what does he want?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>How many apples should he eat each month to meat his goal? (He should eat ___ every month)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>How many apples should he have eaten each month? (In month 2.. 3.. etc.. he should have eaten ___ )</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>OPTIONAL: Make a graph that accurately represents this data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, lets answer the first question. What does he mean? He wants to eat 212 apples in a third of a year (4 months). And he want&#x27;s our help to keep track of it. Well we know that he needs 212 eaten by month 4. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>212 apples : 4 months</li>
<li>106 : 2 . . . 53 : 1</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently 8:30, I ate dinner, and I am gonna continue this. So he needs to eat 53 apples each month. How did I get this? By simply simplifying the relationship. So 212 appls is 4 months, and 106 apples is 2 months. Divide by two once more and you get 53 apples for every one month. Simple.</p>
<p>So in months it would look like</p>
<ul>
<li>Month 1:  53 apples</li>
<li>Month 2: 106 apples</li>
<li>Month 3: 159 apples</li>
<li>Month 4: 212 apples</li>
</ul>
<p>There, that is question 3 answered. For the optional question, I will do it right now.</p>

Wow.</p></div></div>
<p>Back from school, I had lots of fun today. It is hot and the weather is perfect! It is a sunny day with clear skies, in fact I was sweating half the day because of how hot it was. I know I said it was foggy, but now it is sunny. The weather is really unpredictable here, it will probably rain tomorrow.</p>
<p>I went rockclimbing with my class, it cost $8 for two days of rockclimbing. This was the first day, the next will probably next week. Anyways, I tried going up the rockclimbing wall. It was like 2 stories tall, but I still couldn&#x27;t get to the top. My feet could not get a proper hold on the the ledges, so I just fell. I have big feet, but even then I should be able to climb up. My shoes were super thick and bulky, I only have a pair of boots and a pair of thick high-top shoes. I sadly did not get up there, but there is still next time. There were three main things to do at the event.</p>
<ol>
<li>Rock climb (1, 2, and 3 sections were there)</li>
<li>Rope net climb (It is comprised of a net of thin ropes)</li>
<li>Spin hold (You are strapped to a rope, then lifted up with the rope using a human pulley, you are also spun around)</li>
</ol>
<p>I tried number 1, and 2. I couldent make it to the top of 1, I did not have grip. When I did number 2, I got to the top, it was crazy high up. That (#2) was more leg and hand strength. So I did good there, but since my feet are big-ish (Size 13 US &amp; CANADA). Ignore that, but regardless, I did well on the rope net climb. I was one of the only ones to make it to the top, I kept getting tangled in the ropes but kept going. Why didn&#x27;t I try the #3? I was scared okay. It looked frightening, but maybe I should have gone. I will 100% go next time.</p>
<p>I also got a pink sticker commending my efforts. Barely anyone (2-3/30 in a class) got them, it just means you did extremely well. I did good belaying, I did it very fast and well so I got a sticker. It also means that if they need help I can go to help. How did this happen? I went out to play soccer on my break for like 30 minutes, then did rockclimbing, then played soccer till after school ended. I did lots of exersice/sports today, it was fun. Anyways, I will continue the story of my day.</p>
<p>After the day ended and I finished my soccer match (I won, happily), and then I walked home with some friends. When I got 70% to my house I saw a shopping cart, I ran to it with my friends and we decided to use it. I flipped it upright and made it stand up straight, I then had the brilliant Idea of standing on it and having my friend push me. I tried that, I fell off but luckily landed on my feet. I then sat on it and my other friend pushed me, the lot we were in was at an incline so I kept getting faster so I just got off at one point. It was fun, stupid, but fun. I then went back and kept the cart back properly.</p>
<p>A couple girls saw me being dumb with the cart, I want to tell them I was not trying to look tough or &quot;bad&quot; by doing that. I was only having fun. Contrary to my text here, I look very masculine and tough. But really I believe myself to be a good person. I do not care about trends, social media, and whatever the heck people think. I only wish to have fun, enjoy myself, and socialize. That, and learn. But anyways, one of the girls is the one who asked me to be her velentine. She is very pretty, but I wont date till highschool or college.</p>
<p>Being a good person doesn&#x27;t mean being a pushover, or weak. Be a strong man, but choose to be &quot;weak&quot;. If you&#x27;re strong, why do you have to prove it? You&#x27;re weak? Act strong. You&#x27;re strong? Act &quot;weak&quot;. As in don&#x27;t be a bad person. Is it fun to act tough? Yes, 100% it is, but why? It makes us feel good about ourselves, like we matter. We all matter, no one is truly useless. Like Hawking, he could not walk or talk. But he was smart, and you could be too. My motto/thinking is that no one is useless, no one is worthless, nothing is. Nothing is useless, time could be wasted, but it is not useless. It could serve as a lesson as to not do that thing again. But time that is less than worthless is regretful, why? It is a bad thing, disagree? Then you don&#x27;t have your mind on straight. Wasting time, regreting, those are all bad things. Sure, they can be a motivation, for anything. They could be something you need to push yourself to be better. But when you can, don&#x27;t regret. And I don&#x27;t mean dont regret dumb actions or things, I mean don&#x27;t do regretful things. You can&#x27;t take words, actions, or time back. It is cemented in &quot;history&quot;, time? Ah whatever, just be better? Who am I talking too? Me? Myself?</p>
<p>Anyways, I kept writing and... just dont mind it. Some people could argue that you need pain and regret to be better, I agree. But when possible, don&#x27;t do regretful things. Like killing someone, why do that? If you do that for learning experience, there was no need, you wouldn&#x27;t learn anything. There are grey areas in everything, imagine you get heartbroken. What does that mean? Are you sad? Probably, but at the same time, did you want that to happen just so you would feel what it was like to be heartbroken?</p>
<p>Where was I going with this? I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m blasting music in my ears. It is currently 5:30-ish, I will continue this.</p>
<p>As I was saying, things come natural, don&#x27;t rush it? I just got chills down my spine, I&#x27;m talking to myself by typing stuff here. Just me, myself, and I here. The only person in your head is you, do you trust you? Do you like you? Yes, I trust myself, I like myself. Do you hate youself? Don&#x27;t, dont focus on the &quot;good&quot; parts, make the &quot;bad&quot; parts better. I have been typing for a while now, I should get to work. Homework.</p>
<p>Yup. Currently 6:42, I did not do homework. Instead I half-heartedly exersiced. I was on my phone so I kept getting distracted in between sets. I decided to go from regular incline pushups to explosive ones. Why? Because I believe that it trains agility rather than strength? I will finish up some homework then relax.</p>
<p>Did not do homework, just worked on the graph from yesterday&#x27;s apple problem:</p>

<em>Screenshot of yesterday&#x27;s graph.</em></p>
<p>This is the graph from the question about apples, I think I did it correct. Im not sure what the red line is, and I&#x27;m the one who made it. I think it should be a trend line, but not? Anyways, back to work. Currently 7:06. Now 7:35, I finsihed my geography assignment. Lets goo. I will take a break.</p>
<p>Currently a little before 9:00, I ate dinner and then brushed. I will now sleep.</p>

<p>I went to school, I just did my classes. One of my classes is called &quot;DPA&quot;, it is where we go outside for an hour (or thirty minutes). While in DPA, me and my friends tried to get a soccer ball into a basketball hoop, we almost succeded. It was fun, after that, I had Phys-ed. We were in our spike-ball unit. Spike-ball is where you have a small ball, and then you hit/spike it at a trampoline (small). The other person has to spike it back on the trampoline. It goes back and forth, like:</p>

<em>Screenshot of something I made in google slides.</em></p>
<p>This is how it looks. Anyways, it is currently 7:00. I will continue talking. After Phys-ed, my friend asked if I want to play soccer with him. I said yes, I asked my mom, she also said yes. We went to a soccer/football facility and had a great time, it was his dad, him, and me. His dad used to be a Football (soccer) Pro, his shots were incredible. Anyways, I had fun, ran around and had a good work out. I came back at 5:00-ish, then ate food and relaxed till 6:30, I then took a bath. This all took some time so it is now 7:00. I also wrote in the blog, which also took some time. My day is almost over, what now?</p>
<p>Currently 7:15, I don&#x27;t know. I shall spend my remaining time with my family, then exersice.</p>
<p>It is now 8:40-ish, I spent some time with my family, exersiced for a bit. Then ate dinner while watching tv, shortly after I turned it off at the best part of the show. I will now relax and sleep.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-6th-️">March 6th 🛣️<a href="#march-6th-️" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 6th 🛣️" title="Direct link to March 6th 🛣️">​</a></h3>
<p>I went to school and came back around 4:00. It is currently 4:22. I will now relax for a bit, and eat something, I did not eat my lunch today. Why? Because the school handed out pizza today, it is a reasonable cost. I will relax and eat now.</p>
<p>Currently a little before 5:30, I ate 1 1/2 of a sandwich and 3/4 of a mango juice. It was a bagel sandwich. I will now,  <em><strong>30 minutes later</strong></em>... exersice. Currently 6:00, I wasted time for a little bit (regretfully), then did 41 pushups. My form I tried to keep my back straight, for the most part I did. I struggle to do even 5 pushups but miraculously did 41 (not simultaneous) pushups. How? I took mostly 1-4 seconds between pushups,  but how did I get 41? My highest was 20 pushups, that too I struggled so much to do that much. I believe the reason why I could do almost 2x the amount of pushups I could do last time, is because I trained to explode. What does that mean? I don&#x27;t know, I just made it up, but by my definition, it means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doing any type of pushup explosively</li>
</ul>
<p>Like instead of a gradual push, just do it so hard your top half gets lifted off the ground. I&#x27;ve been doing that now-a-days and have noticed an incredible improvement. To push, you need strength, doing it explosively increases strength? I just know that it helped.</p>
<p>Ahh my head is really fuzzy right now, my head is light (?). I think I&#x27;m sick? I dunno, but anyways, I think maybe I need sleep? I haven&#x27;t really been sleeping too well lately, as you have read I just cannot (most of the time) sleep. That or I wake up every 30 minutes and don&#x27;t fall back asleep for another hour. Sleeping felt like something I&#x27;d never have lack of, but now it feels like treasure, I want it? Yes I do, I can just force myself awake like right now, but in 2 seconds my eyes get heavy. So why dont I sleep? I dont want to, why? My heads cleared up! (No it has not) I will exersice some more, I dont want to study? I&#x27;m tired, I need to relax, but will I regret it? Maybe, but would I regret not sleeping more? Maybe, I don&#x27;t know, I will relax <strong>and</strong> exersice.</p>
<p>I just took a big sip of mango juice, it partially woke me up. I will now relax and exersice. I guess I dont feel relaxed unless I&#x27;m being productive. Damn it my head is in shambles, I will tough it out, tis only a light cold. I feel relieved, now I dont. When I write that I feel bad, I feel good. And when I write I feel good I feel bad. SO... I feel bad. Currently 6:30-ish, after writing here it is now 6:30. I spent 30 minutes just typing. Now I will exersice and relax. I feel bad.</p>
<p>Currently 7:00-ish, I feel relaxed and better, I did some explosive incline pushups while reading a book. The pain is gone (?), I think. I feel better. You know maybe why I can&#x27;t get a good rest at night is because I&#x27;m not relaxed, I mean think about it, to sleep, dont you have to be relaxed? Probably, most likely, for sure. I dont feel tired. I will do some school work.</p>
<p>Currently 7:30, I just spent some time on a presentation I will present soon. It has been delayed but I will present it tomorrow. The day went by fast, it is already time to eat dinner. Have I done much today? Yes, I exercised, ate food, and relaxed. I did a good amount today, now I will eat dinner. Now 7:39. Ate dinner it is now 8:08, I ate chicken and rice, it was delicious. I wil relax now.</p>
<p><em>Next day, slept.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-7th-">March 7th 👎<a href="#march-7th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 7th 👎" title="Direct link to March 7th 👎">​</a></h3>
<p>Woke up, showered, and now will go to school. Today is rest day, I shall sleep when I get home.</p>
<p>Currently 5:05, I am home. I went to school, we had buddies today! Buddies is a program where 1st graders hang out with the upper grades to have fun or learn. It gives a break for the teachers and the students, the little buddies themselves (1st graders) often learn things like courage, leadership skills, and more. This is an amazing program.</p>
<p>Anyways, I said I will sleep didn&#x27;t I. I will not, I don&#x27;t want to. I will instead exersice first, then sleep. Why? I feel like it, I don&#x27;t wanna sleep. But it is good for me. Currently 5:32, I was just talking with my parents for a bit. I drank a glass of milk too. Now I&#x27;ll exersice.</p>
<p>I did 30 pushups, 6 sets of 5 with like a 5 second break between them. I can do pushups now! Lets gooo, I feel like a can do them properly, which counts more. I am happy, as I get taller and heavier, I should also gain more muscle. Pushups are good, they are a great way to make you feel better. Does this rhyme?:</p>
<p>I used to struggle to do like 4, now I can do much more. I feel like I was newly-born, and yes I mean to toot my own horn. I used to struggle, now I can do double. Triple in fact I don&#x27;t mean to be humble. But... wait I should get back to it, cause I want to be fit. End.</p>
<p>Back to work. Currently 7:36, I exersiced a little. And then I tried going to sleep for an hour, I could not sleep. In fact I feel worse than I did before. Why? My brother kept aking me up, I <strong>need</strong> sleep. But anyways, I will talk about my day.</p>
<p>So I presented to the class on how to animate in google slides, it went well. Then our teacher let us go out to play sooner than expected, we got to see the 4th graders play. Contrary to my expectations, they were tiny. Like they looked like kindergarteners. Aside from thaat they were good at soccer, me and my buddies (the four of us) faced off against two of them. We got smoked, destroyed, annihilated, and creamed. Why? They were just that good, we were getting crossed out, megged, and got shoved/pushed aside. By these little (very little) kids. It was fun though, moving on. In our core class we has buddies, as I mentioned before it is a great thing. I wrote an entire essay on it, litteraly. The 1st graders came to our room, I volunteered to read the a book. It was a good book about persevarance. I read it, and when I was done we had a competition. It was to see who could make the best (furthest flying) paper airplane. The (obvious) twist was that the buddies (1st graders) had to be the ones to throw them. I made the perfect airplane, it could tavel accross the entire hall. But it requires lots of force to use, my buddy threw it softly. But I had fun, my friend won and his buddy was estatic. It was a fun day. I just... gonna eat dinner.</p>
<p>Currently 7:46. Now 8:40, I ate dinner.</p>
<p><em>Slept</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-8th-ℹ️">March 8th ℹ️<a href="#march-8th-ℹ️" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 8th ℹ️" title="Direct link to March 8th ℹ️">​</a></h3>
<p>It is currently 6:30, what happened?</p>
<p>So, I had school today. It was cool, car made, goal shot josh wow, spike ball 5th to 12th, swung on swings Janat metcalf, amir dance greason bodied, farewell sad song, waving at cars amir &amp; I, park gone jean steckle, plant apple, sad song bye Hiro, and temple.</p>
<p>These are all events you wouldn&#x27;t know except me, they hold value only (?) to myself and those present at those times. I will elaborate. I shall do 10 pushups before writing each topic. Just did 20 consecutive pushps am happy.</p>
<p>Car Made.</p>
<p>So for the past week in science class we made a toy car, out of wood and other materials. It is not what you think; all we were given was a small flat wooden board, a couple materials, and a battery. My car worked, it was very fast, the car looked very bad but it still worked. Anyways, on to the next topic.</p>
<p>Goal shot Josh Wow.</p>
<p>While I was playing soccer at school, I decided to be goalie, because I am tall and good at goalie. It was fun, then my (chubby white) friend Josh kicked the ball. The ball curved and was going high, it looked as if it would go in the goal, but I blocked it. It was the best shot I&#x27;ve seen, he took it from the corner but had an amazing shot. He was made later on, but still amazed at his own skill.</p>
<p>Spike Ball 5th To 12th.</p>
<p>So in Phys-ed, we were playing with the class 8-3. The game was spike ball, the game was not 8-5 (us) against 8-3. It was just a class with both classes together. A there was a pretty girl (the one who told me she liked me), she really is pretty. Off topic, moving on our teacher decided to do a ranking system. We would have cards and put our teams names on them, the cards would be assigned ranks randomly. You can challenge a team who is withen 3 ranks of you. My team got randomly chosen as 5th, we got lucky. After that we won every game (like 3-5 games) but then lost on one. The team we played against played mind games. They wound up their arm as if they were going to hit it hard, then just lightly tapped it. And when they would pretend to lightly tap it, they just smacked it super hard. After we lost we went down to 7th place. You swap places with the opponent if you lose, or win. We were in 5th, they were in 7th. We lost, so we had to swap places. After that we lost match after match, I got mad and kept losing. I lost my composure, I then just stuck to watching people play. We ended up in 12th place at last, we lost to 2 girls who kept taunting us. They didn&#x27;t mean it though, just jokes, they told me. They are actully quite nice, they just act &quot;sassy&quot;. I then changed and headed out of school.</p>
<p>Swung On Swings Janet Metcalf</p>
<p>After heading out of school, I walked and found Hiro, he is a good friend of mine. I spend like all day with him (kinda), I talked for a bit then headed to the school park. Once we got there <del>I sat on the bench and</del> I talked with him, (I did not actully sit on the bench, nor did he) we ran to the swings and started swinging. It was fun, but the swings were small as he and I were like 5,9 or taller. I don&#x27;t know how tall I am, I am just 5,9.5-ish or something. I don&#x27;t know, but moving on. Some friends came, we said &quot;have a nice march break&quot; and they went on their way back home. We were waiting for some friends to join us for the walk home. When our friends came we just sat on the bench and talked, then Temari walked by. I wished I said something, I would have said &quot;have a nice march break, your very pretty&quot; or something. But no words came out, I felt shame, no I was just dissapointed. All that said and done I went and walked home with my friends. While walking something happened, something very funny.</p>
<p>Greason Bodied Amir Dance</p>
<p>The funny thing that happened while we were walking is that Amir started to dance, he is an amazing (super duper talented genius) pianist, but sometimes acts acoustic. He randomly started dancing in the middle of the sidewalk, I took my phone out to record. He told me &quot;no no, record on my phone&quot;, so I did record his dance on his phone. His full name is Amirhossien R. He did a cat-like dance, it was very cringy but I still recorded. As he continued, my (soon to be) friend named Greason just bodied him. He ran and shoved amir by the shoulders, Amir went flying. He fell down and pretended to be dead. I had caught that on video, ha. I gave him his phone back and asked him to send it to me, he said no. Just then, I relised how (stupidly) smart he is. If I had recorded on my own phone, I could have sent it to people. But since I took it on his phone, it is his choice. That way no one will see his cringy video. Smart, moving on I got aquantinced with the person who bodied (full body shoved) Amir, he seemed nice. He just couldent stand to make the people driving by witness the cringe. He seemd nice, after that we just kept walking.</p>
<p>Farewell Sad Song</p>
<p>After walking for a bit, we got to a round-about. It was where Rasham and Amir would part ways with Hiro and I. I played a sad-ish song and we parted ways, we made it very dramatic. I (and hiro) just watched their backs, till Amir stopped.</p>
<p>Waving at cars Amir and I</p>
<p>So after Amir stopped he randomly started waving at cars, Rasham was visibly annoyed. Amir was goofily waving at the cars, they waved back. I decided to do the same, people waved back at me, it was fun. Till we decided to head back, I shouted to Amir, &quot;BYE&quot;, then left.</p>
<p>Park Gone Jean Steckle</p>
<p>So after saying farewells we went to the Jean steckle park, we just swung around, I finsihed the apple I&#x27;d been eating since leaving school. I ate like 4 apples today. One at school, one at home, another two outside home or school. We just relaxed at the park and sat on a bench. We saw Greason there, we introduced oursleves again and said farewells to him. We then did something random.</p>
<p>Plant Apple</p>
<p>The apple core was just dwelling in my hand, so I decided to plant it. I got the idea from Hiro who jokingly suggested it. I also found a random platic water bottle that someone just left there. So I used all the water to feed the seeds, I have the plastic water bottle in my bag, I try not to litter. Moving on.</p>
<p>Sad Song Bye Hiro</p>
<p>As I was saying farewell to Hiro as we left the park, I put &quot;Blue Bird&quot;, from Naruto. It is an amazing song, moving on, we made that very dramatic. But it was so much fun, being a good person has never led me astray. I am lucky, yes.</p>
<p>Temple</p>
<p>Once I got back home we went straight to the temple. Today is Shivratri, so we went to a temple. The entire temple was full of people, dozens and doznes of people crowded the temple. It was a sight to see. As the puja was happening, I knew that india has very strong cultural roots. It is the oldest and wisest religeon.</p>
<hr>
<p>Back to right now, 8:15 on the dot. I did some pushups while writing this. I also wasted some time, regretfully. I will now show a photo of a drawing I made in art class.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr45-072851869b7c0be9c46e78b7e121f86a.jpg" width="2072" height="4608" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>It is a drawing I made in art class, I will add clouds and stuff. It will turn out great, trust me. I will now work on it. Currently 10:00, I ate dinner and am going to sleep. I hope you know that the dragon is in water.</p>
<p><em>Next day, slept.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-9th-">March 9th 💪<a href="#march-9th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 9th 💪" title="Direct link to March 9th 💪">​</a></h3>
<p>I woke up at 7:30, it is currently 8:00. I wasted time on my phone, during that time I could have done some pushups, and studied for a little. Why didn&#x27;t I? I did not have that clear goal in mind, but from now on I will. I will do 20 pushups. Done, now I will study. Just saw I was missing an assignment, I turned it in, this is what I wrote. Is it correct?</p>
<p>&quot;The relationship between work, force, and displacement is simple, I had the gear group. As we put the same amount of effort into each sized gear, the gears had the same amount of work/energy/force transferred to them. If the driving gear would be the biggest it would go very fast. If the driving gear is the smallest it would go slower but stronger, based on our data the force projected onto the not driving gear was equal. But since the gear is smaller, it would have many more rotations. So when big spins once, little would spin many times. The car itself would be made out of wheels, wood, battery, and gears. The gears were connected to the wheel, so when gear spun so did wheel, this caused the car to go forward. Thus it was displaced, it moved according to our data 22 seconds in the north direction, it was displaced 22 seconds north. We could not measure it because you asked our group not to, as our car went too far. So the force determines the work of the spinning object, and the more it spins, and the more torpe to weight ratio it has, the further and faster it will go. And how far it goes is how far the object was displaced. Force -&gt; (work) -&gt; Displacement. How much it was displaced is the work acted upon the object, how much force was put in can determine the displacement of the object, our car. Since the gears were attached to the wheels any force acted upon them by way of gears would be transferred (work) to the rotation/acceleration of the wheels, causing the car to move.&quot;</p>
<p>I dont know if this is correct, but it is what I understood of our lesson in class. I will now study. Did not study, just did random things, I also updated the emojies for March 7th and 8th. Currently 9:00, I spent some time reading what I wrote for March 8th. I read the entire thing, it has terrible grammer, very bad. I was half asleep while writing it, can you blame me? Its fun writing stuff down, its not going anywhere. My father barely remembers what he did when he was my age. So if I write stuff down, I can refer to it later in case of forgeting. Yesterday was the best I&#x27;d felt in a long time, I feel ify right now, but yesterday I felt very manly and strong. I was proud of how I looked, I felt like the best. I now know why, if you surround youself with nice people, you will be nice. Surround youself with people with strong morals, and strength, you too will become stronger. Testoserone, wow. Crazy feeling that rush of adrenaline, amazing though.</p>
<p>Now I&#x27;ll go see my parents. Currently 12:11, I talked with my parents, then ate breakfeast. Afterwards I exersiced for a while, I can easily do 10 pushups now. I am very happy, I couldent do 5 without struggling, now I can do 10 easy. Lets goo, my muscles are huge now, I feel better. Exersice really is the way to go. I will relax now.</p>
<p>Currently 2:30, I ate lunch, poutine frok costco. It was amazing, really good. I am drawing my dragon piece. Went to park, came back at like 5:30. I then relaxed and exersiced till 7:00, I then ate dinner. It is now 8:30-ish, I will draw.</p>
<p><em>Currently the next day, I ate dinner then slept.</em></p>

<p>I woke up, then exersiced for a bit, doing dimond pushups works your forearms, wow. Anyways, I drew.</p>

<em>Photo of my progress so far.</em></p>
<p>I used pen marker to outline it, then I colored a little bit. Currently 11:30, I ate breakfeast and now I wrote this. I will relax for a bit, relaxed. Then exersiced for some time, ate lunch. I then played games, then relaxed, then exersiced, then spent time with my family. After that, I played outside with my brother for an hour. It is snowing a good amount, so yeah. It is currently 7:00, the day was good. I will now relax for a bit.</p>
<p>Currently 7:30-ish. Now 9:22, I wasted some time, then ate dinner. My mother made chicken, it was delicious. I brushed an am in bed. I mostly just relaxed and exersiced today, was I productive? I&#x27;d say yes, I was not very productive, but I&#x27;m content.</p>
<p><em>Next day, slept. Barely.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-11th-">March 11th ✨<a href="#march-11th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 11th ✨" title="Direct link to March 11th ✨">​</a></h3>
<p>I got little sleep, my brother kept kicking me at night, I am frustrated. I can&#x27;t sleep lately, or if I do sleep, I wake up shortly after. I need sleep, it is important right? Alright, I ate breakfeast, then exersiced for a good amount. I took a shower, and talked with my dad. From now on, my days will be: Wake up, eat breakfeast, learn coding, lunch, learn math, relax, learn biology, dinner, sleep. There is more than enough time in a day to do this.</p>
<p>Currently 11:59, now 12:00.</p>
<table><tr><th></th><th scope="col">Saturday</th><th scope="col">Sunday</th></tr><tr><th scope="row">Goodness</th><td>Good</td><td>Good</td></tr></table>
<p>Found out how to do some more <em>cool</em> things. Yeah, anyways, back to work. It is monday by the way. Currently 12:30-ish, I am learning about how to properly make tables. I have made mediocre ones so far, I will learn how to better them. I spent the last hour just learning Html.</p>
<table><tr><th>Starving</th><th>Hungry</th><th>Not hungry</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2">I Want food</td><td>I Dont want food</td></tr></table>

<p>Credit to CodeAcedemy for showing how to make tables, you should check it out. It is very cool, just like KhanAcedemy, but for code.</p>

<p>Moving on, I will eat lunch soon. Ate lunch (shrimp linguini pasta with corn and peas), it was pheanomanal. My mother made it, it is very tasty. I then took my brother to the park, we played basketball. He does not know how to walk, he is 7. I taught him how to walk, run, throw the ball. And also not to act weak, he is small. He does not eat much, I want him to be better. He is weak right now, I am too. I need to become better, stronger. We all do, our purpose is to improve.  The meaning of life? Existence. The solution to world hunger? Stop people from overeating (you know what I mean). It may sound like a joke, but 40% of the world is overweight. Don&#x27;t take my word for it, I just looked it up. But it is safe to say that this is true. There are some people dying of too much food, and some dying of too little food. Why? I have no clue. This was random anyways, I will continue.</p>
<p>I taught my brother some soccer things, basketball things. Yeah, now I am learning about how to evaluate functions on graphs. Currently 4:20, what am I doing? Playing music, while doing studying. Multitasking, yes.</p>
<p>Update: Multitasking is not working, I am distracted by the music. I made the mistake of getting 24 from 12-36. I will now stop the music. Currently 5:38, I wasted time, I regret it. I spent some time trying to get 4/4 on a knowldge check, I keep failing. I have restarted like 8 times already. I then wasted time to clear my mind. I then failed another 3 times, so yeah, now for each time I fail. I do 10 pushups, I&#x27;ve done 30 so far. I will do another set, yes I failed again. Forty so far, dang it. I just made the mistake of getting 6 from -2*-3. This is teaching me to read the question and double check before submitting the answer. I will do another set. Fifty so far, ahh man. Currently 6:10, I have gotten 3/4 questions correct, my free time hinges on this last question. I am lost, anyways, it is very nice and sunny today. Yesterday it was snowing like a snowstorm, today it is sunny and hot. Back to work.</p>
<p>I did it, I have gotten all 4 right. I got a 4/4, lets goooo. I tried too many times but I still managed to succed, nice.</p>
<p><em>Next day, ate dinner, slept on floor.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-12th-️">March 12th ☀️<a href="#march-12th-️" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 12th ☀️" title="Direct link to March 12th ☀️">​</a></h3>
<p>I slept on the floor last night, why? So I could sleep, my brother keeps kicking me and rolling on me at night. I did not get any sleep, I watched the sun set, and the sun rise. I watched the sky change its hue why I was just not able to sleep. My dad said I did sleep, but I know I didn&#x27;t. Maybe I slept for 30 minutes only to wake up aferwards. Why is this happening? I don&#x27;t know, I just can&#x27;t sleep. It has been weeks, but still I don&#x27;t get much sleep.</p>
<p>So once I got out of bed  (floor) this morning, I then went to my parents room and slept. I think I got some sleep, my body feels sore and I feel like throwing up. That&#x27;s a good sign though, that means my body relaxed and was healing my everything. On nights I don&#x27;t sleep I can get out of bed with zero hesitation. But when I get sleep, I feel tired in the morning. Why? Because my body relaxed and shut off, to heal. If it does not relax, it will not shut off (?). But anyways, I ate breakfeast right now.</p>
<p>I watched Tv, it was The Avatar but realistic. I don&#x27;t like it, why? It could have been better, honestly should have been better. I know, I know, &quot;you can&#x27;t make something like that&quot;. I cannot, but still, it was not great. I was rooting for the son of the firelord, but they made his character so childish. The person playing the avatar did not do good enough, his acting was hard to watch. I don&#x27;t know but they made the avatar kinda lame, they did the same to the son of the firelord. I may be being a critic but, the amount of forced things in it was ehh. The dialoge sounded forced, but I could be wrong.</p>
<p>Back to work, I will code. I don&#x27;t know what this is:</p>
<label for="meal">What do you want to eat?</label>
<input name="meal" id="meal">
<br>
<label>What is your password for Blooket?</label>
<input type="password" name="meal2" id="meal2">
<br>
<label>How many brain cells do you have?</label>
<input type="number" step="1" id="meal2">
<br>
<label>How happy is your shoe?</label>
<br>
<span>Sad</span>
<input type="range" min="0" max="100" step="1">
<span>Happy</span>
<br>
<br>
<p>Anyways, it is hot outside. Took a break (I exersiced) for about 30 minutes or so. It was relaxing, I soon relized that there are bugs outside. Not one or two, but like 30 on my window. And around like 50 flies on my mothers window. I hate bugs, that is why I like Canada. It is too cold for bugs here, so they go somewhere else, but now, it is warm and sunny. So bugs come out, dang it. I will now relax some more.</p>
<p>Currently 12:59, now 1:00. Just watched some &quot;scary things found in abandoned places&quot; type youtube videos. Some of the things were just unsetteling, and very few were actully scary. Why be afraid of ghosts and stuff, be afraid of humans. There are 8 billion humans, you are one of them. So am I, but I see the world through my own eyes. My just means I, me, but no. We are all humans, but different in a way. You can&#x27;t feel my pain, nor I you. But we can try, such is the dilema of empathy. To feel bad for others, or to not. I choose to feel bad, for things out of control. Imagine your friend gets an F in a class, would you feel bad? Why or why not. Or imagine if your friend gets an F simply because your teacher didn&#x27;t like his skin color. Would you feel emotion on his behalf?</p>
<p>My point being, we are who we are, and we arent who we are not. So to feel pain on anothers behalf is folly? No, it could be fake. Morals, obligations, emotions, it is all so complex. If you make it that is, be a good person, be responsible for your obligations, and control your emotions. It sounds easy to say does it not? But it isn&#x27;t, I too struggle with controlling my emotions. I feel proud of the things I&#x27;m responsible for, it gives me purpose. I enjoy having good morals, it gives me belief and confidence in myself. You too should consider what I&#x27;ve said.</p>
<p>Anyways, I will go eat lunch. :)</p>
<p>You can choose to listen to what I said, but whatever. Currently 2:30-ish. Now it is 4:30-ish. What have I been doing? I spent some time talking to my mom, then went outside with my brother. I played with him till 3:30, then went to Tim Horten&#x27;s with my family. I got an Ice cap, my brother got a M&amp;M cookie, and yeah. The Ice cap was amazing, exquisite, the taste was legendary. The quality was amazing, BUT 75% of it is ICE. I was so mad when I drank 25% of it, and had no coffe left, only ice. Not even Starbucks does that. Starbucks charged like 7 USD, here charges 4 CAD. I can see why though, the quantity is minimal. The taste is great, dont get me wrong, but come on. At least Starbucks had 75% of it&#x27;s drink be coffee, here is the opposite.</p>
<p>Still, the Ice cap&#x27;s taste is something to be tried. I am currently drinking water, from a coffee cup. Why? For the sole reason I just talked about previously. It is all ice/water, so yup. Anyways, back to work.</p>
<p>Currently 4:59, now 5:00. I just relaxed and read a little. One character in my book made the choice to save the one he loves, but she does not want to be saved. She does not want to die, before finsihing her goal. He attmepts to save her by fleeing with her, after he takes her away from the source of her sadness. But she got cursed so she has to finish her goal, or she will die. So she parts ways with him, he ends up in bars for trying to help her. She thinks he is crazy, she was using him, but he loves her. So he would do anything for her, but she ends up refusing him/his help/everything.</p>
<p>Back to work, math. Currently 5:30-ish, I&#x27;m too lazy to do math right now, why? I just don&#x27;t want to. Why? I do not want to do math right now, why? I will exersice, some stretches. Currently 5:42, I did some stretching and decided to show my dominance to my chair. It needed a reminder who&#x27;s boss, so I repped it for 2 sets of 100. It got tired of my repping it so I stopped. I benched it 200 times, it was light work. Truth be told, it was a good workout. Anyways, now I&#x27;ll do some math.</p>
<p>Dog owners these days, wild. They just causually take their dog outside and let it poop everywhere, just broad daylight. Like invent a public dog toilet at this point. It is absurd the amount of dog poop just everywhere, pick it up. I mean don&#x27;t just leave it there please. It is disgusting, pick it up. But anyways, back to work.</p>
<p>I did not get back to work, instead, I studied for like 10 minutes then fought with my brother for a good 30 minutes. I then spent another 30 minutes with my mom, we played with soft toys. It was around 6:30 or so when I got back to my room. I then spent an hour repping my chair. It kept complaining while I repped it 1000 times. I did this in sets of 10 times 100. It was actually very good. It was a great work out, I felt like quitting at 400, but kept going till 1000. My chair kept squeking, moving on.</p>
<p>In total I repped my chair 1200 times today, not bad, I can improve though. It is now 7:35, I still have visions of myself benching the chair. My exaustion is leading my to hulicinate the chair above my head as I benched it. I think I spent too long, I feel light headed, huh. It is the blood rushing down my body, I was laying down as I was doing it. It was fun, I will eat an apple or something now.</p>
<p>SH-- I keep seeing the chair in front of me, it haunts me. It is actually so weird, ahhhhh. I am hungry and tired, whoooo. I am losing it, I see it&#x27;s silluete hanging in front of me. I am sitting on it, but still I see it. I will head to the living room, clear my head.</p>
<p>Ignore the previous paragraph it is cringy, I feel a lot better after taking a bit of an apple. I will relax for a bit, yes.</p>
<p><em>Next day, I slept after eating dinner.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-13th-">March 13th 🤩<a href="#march-13th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 13th 🤩" title="Direct link to March 13th 🤩">​</a></h3>
<p>I woke up at 7:00, I had a good nights rest. Finally, I slept. I woke up maybe three times, but slept right after. I feel great, I got a good sleep. Words cannot express how relieved I am, but anyways. I exersiced a little, then ate breakfeast, then exersiced. And then I played games for a little bit, I then talked to my great grandma. It is her 92nd birthday today, amazing. I thought she was around 70-80, but no. She can talk, hear, and do everything properly. She is healthy, I am happy. Not many live to that age.</p>
<p>Anyways, I played SlimeRancher for a while, it is one of my favorite games. It is so, so fun. Try it, you will not regret it. I could play it for hours, it is relaxing and just a great game. But, I am not gonna overdo it by wasting time. Play, turn off, study. I will learn some HTML. Currently 10:14, now 10:15.</p>
<label for="q_1">Did you sleep at night?</label>
<input id="q_1" name="topping" type="checkbox">
<br>
<br>
<p>Moving on.</p>
<p>What is sum of 2 + 1?</p>

<br>
<input type="radio" id="eleven" name="answer" value="11">
<label for="eleven">21</label>
<br>
<br>
<p>If you picked 21 you are not correct, why? I&#x27;m not sure, but 2 = 1+1. So it would be 1+1+1 which is three ones. So 3*1 which is 2*1 + 1*1. So 2+1, we just end up back at 2+1. Can anyone explain how 2+1=3?</p>
<label for="q_2">How old are you?</label>

<br>
<p>These small things are pretty useful, what for, I do not know. All I know is these effects are cool and intresting, so I will continue figuring out how to use them.</p>

<br>
<p>So, it is 11:22, there is a crane in front of me. It has three men smoking in it, they seem to be having a joy ride. It looks fun, just riding in a crane while it takes you high. Getting high while going higher, wow. HOLY they are in front of my window, they are staring at me. I looked back, they seem friendly. I think they are walking on my roof, I hear loud thuds. Why though? I heard a giant boom above me, I am a little scared. Why are they on my roof? Could they be reparing something? They are drilling or something, loud thuds above me. THEY STARTED PLAYING MUSIC, hahaha. Should I be concerned? Is there a tree on my roof or something? I hear footsteps and a chainsaw, why? The music stopped, but I&#x27;m still confused. They might just be workers fixing something. Well alright, nice, if they fix something it is better for me. I will go talk to my dad about this.</p>
<p>I talked to my mom, she is as confused as I am. I guess it is for the best. I will continue learning. They started blasting music, it is kinda fire. Dang, wow, kinda makes me ignore the giant explosions on my roof. They are playing &quot;Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1&quot; not bad.</p>
<p>Currently 1:03, my computer was running slow and was laggy. I took a break and went to play games, I played for an hour. It was fun, but I feel sick. Clearly playing games is bad for my health, anyways. The guys have hammered and sawed and drilled on my roof. They are building something on my roof. Moving on, I will exersice for s bit. My mind hurts, playing games really exausted me.</p>
<p>I feel like throwing up, was playing games really that bad? I know I haven&#x27;t played in like weeks, but still. This bad a reaction for playing? I need to not play games anymore, or less than I already do. I guess it takes having a clear mind to relise how bad it is. Back to exersicing.</p>
<p>Currently 2:04, I did not exersice. I went to Mc.Donalds with my family. It was very tasty, the  Mc.Donalds in Canada is much better tasting. Why? It does not taste like plastic, but at the same time chicken is pricy. Alright, I will check if I have any homework.</p>

<p>These were pretty simple, but the answers were: 30, 17, #2, 25. Yeah, the inputs are very useful for these kinda things. Glad I figured out how to do this.</p>
<p>So, do you have a favorite food? If so, what? <input></p>
<hr>
<p>Enough of that, I will do some math. It is Wedensday, 2:58, I just learned how to calculte unknown probabilities. Probabilities, values, fractions, and etc. It is simple if you use a formula, but to use a formula you need to use your brains to know where to use it. Anyways, 2:59, now 3:05. I spent some time listening to music, there is this one song. &quot;INOHA - Seventh Heaven&quot;, it is a great song.</p>
<p>I will do some stretches or something, maybe talk to my family. Currently 4:40, talked, played games, etc.</p>
<p>I will take care of something, 4:55, I will bench my chair afterwards. It disrespected me, it stubbed my toe. (Im kidding) Anyways, I will do like 500. Currently 5:17, I did the 500. I feel strong in places/muscles I never knew. My arm feels solid, working out is worth it. I feel better and more confident, more than I was. I have a lot of confidence in myself, I think I&#x27;m the best. I see someone taller than me, I don&#x27;t think. &quot;Golly, it is a-okay, I&#x27;m still a tall boy&quot;. I think; &quot;I am taller&quot;. Why? I don&#x27;t know, It makes me feel better. Faking confidence is still comfidence if your confident that you faked it right? No, that&#x27;s motivation. Moving on, it is 5:20, I will exersice some more.</p>
<p>Currently 6:00, what did I do? I&#x27;m not sure, I was just laying on the floor watching my phone. I think laying on the floor is good for my posture. Alright, I will study up on some biology stuff.</p>
<p>Currently 6:30, the time flew. So fast, its crazy. Anyways, I learned some more about cells, and about them. I also learned about how a cell behaves during mitosis. Another thing I heard/saw was about homeostasis, the want to maintain internal heat dispite the outside effects. We need it, it is kinda like a warning. &quot;Your overheating!&quot; Or &quot;Your too cold seek warmth!&quot;. Is what I understood. So when stimulated by the heat, your body will sweat to become cooler. Stimulus, is identified, then countered. So counteracted stimuli, with a response from the body. Something like that, do not take my word.</p>
<p>THERMOREGULATION . . . (you can guess what it means)</p>
<p>What a long word, makes you doubt english. But anyways, I will continue.</p>
<p>OSMOEREGULATION</p>
<p>Another big word, the act of maintaining salt levels in body. For some fish I believe.</p>
<p>These two things are caused by negitive feedback loops, like &quot;Oh no, its too hot! DO SOMETHING&quot;. I think, or. &quot;It is cold, activate the defences!&quot;</p>
<p>Anyways, I will continue. There is also positive feedback, like &quot;The baby is big! Get ready to give birth&quot; or something. I just saw a man find a peice of trash on the floor. He picked it up and put it in a trash can, good job. Small things make big differences. Currently 7:00-ish, it is sunny outside. Because of daylight savings or something we get another hour of sunlight. It is just a mental thing, the only things wound up are the clocks, and the people who believe in daylight savings. It is all for show.</p>
<p>Anyways, I have 20% in highschool biology in Khanacedemy. I know this does not mean much, but to me I feel proud. I learned some facts I did not know, I learned about the human body. I unlocked the secret to sleep, relax. No bull, just relax. Your breath, your eyes, your muscles. They need to relax, do not clear your mind, do not fill it. When a thought comes up, follow it, do not run past it. Stay with the thought till you forget where you are, drift into another plane... Your dreams need to become &quot;reality&quot; in the sense of removing the remeberance of where you are in space. Let go, just relax, catch a thought, ride the though. Sleep.</p>
<p>This took me weeks of sleepless nights to understand, lately I&#x27;ve been pumped up. Maybe cause of hormones???</p>
<p>Currently 8:36, I will brush then sleep. I ate dinner, it was tasty. Currently 9:00-ish, I brushed and did my skin care routine. I put ance cream on, then washed it off. Instead of buying useless junk, buy skin care products. They make you look better, and if you look better you might feel better. And if you feel better you might do better, so next time you want to buy a DLC or video games, just buy something that would make you happy. Video games make you happy? Alright enjoy, but make sure your health comes first. Anyways, I will sleep.</p>

<p>I&#x27;ve decided not to waste time, less than I already do. I heard a song with the lyrics:</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m done, with wasting my ti-i-ime&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve got so much to live foor&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lets go for one hell of a ri-i-ide&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t wanna end up homeless, no one does. So you gotta have money, to get money work a job. To get job be smart, to be smart work hard. To work hard spend time working hard. To spend time working hard you need to find time to spend. Spend time on spending time working hard. This means don&#x27;t waste time.</p>
<label for="blog">Is wasting time good? And why or why not? : </label>
<br>
<textarea id="blog" name="blog" rows="5" cols="30">Write your thoughts here</textarea>
<br>
<br>
<p>This makes my blog more interactive, cool. I read a little of my &quot;day 12&quot; March, what if people read this? Woulden&#x27;t that be funny? I write my thoughts here, but at the same time it serves to remind me of what to do. If I havent wrote down I exersiced today, I will exersice. If I havent studied, I will. It gives me a chance to reflect and look at my day unbiased. Only information is info from me on this blog. Yet I can learn from it, anyways, back to work.</p>
<input type="submit" value="Click?">
<br>
<br>
<p>Just read some more about HTML using CodeAcedemy, it is very cool. So much useful stuff, yet how do I remember it? I learn it, the different types of types in inputs. The inputs I&#x27;ve put here are mostly different types, it was just to experiment on how to do it. It is very useful, go try.</p>
<p>Currently 10:41, what did I do?</p>
<p>When I woke up, I had choice. To waste time, or to not. I chose to waste time, and then read up on HTML. Afterwards I was struck with another choice, exersice, or play games. I (lightly) exersiced till 9:30, then played games till 10:30. I ate breakfast, it was tasty.</p>
<p>Anyways, I will continue learning. QUICK UPDATE: You know how yesterday some guys went on my roof? Yeah they did it again today, thought it is good. I see their crane in front of my window. Like 5 feet away from my face, it is extended to my roof. They are blasting music yet again, it is shaking my room. But whatever, they are doing a good thing. I bet I can touch the crane if I stick man hand out the window. No, never mind, my hand isn&#x27;t 5 feet long. I will continue learning, why not. They are cracking jokes while working, nothing improves moral like cracking a joke. The music is upbeat and lively, sounds fun. They are having a party on my roof, ha. If that makes them work better, happier, then it is fine.</p>
<input type="tel" id="phone" name="phone" placeholder="This is a placeholder">
<br>
<br>
<p>Found out another nifty thing, placeholders. It is another thing like &quot;id, type, name&quot; but it is called &quot;placeholder&quot;. So placeholder=&quot;text&quot; kinda thing. If you use HTML you should understand.</p>
<p>What is a 16 letter word?</p>
<input id="summary" name="summary" minlength="16" maxlength="16" required="" pattern="">
<br>
<br>
<p>Anyways, I put Thermoregulation. I spaced out for a good ten minutes, lost what I was doing. Currently 11:30-ish I will continue. These guys are getting lowered by the crane, I don&#x27;t think they see me. I think they are leaving, alright. It looks super unsteady, like one guy is using a controller to control the crane. Like man it is not a toy, you will crash into the cars. Maybe he is good at racing games or parking games, using a controller to control a crane is next level. But if it works it works.</p>
<p>Currently 12:05, just been listening to music. Currently 12:12, back to work. I don&#x27;t wanna, I will relax. By relax I meant exerisce, currently 12:38. I did 2 pushups for every 2 scentences of the book I read. I ended up reading 2 pages, nice. I am getting better at doing pushups. Before I struggled with 2, now I struggle with 20. I do pushups everyday, so I&#x27;m bound to get stronger. Exersice is good for you, why? It will make you feel, look, and be better. I learned this pretty late, months back I thought exersice was bad. Now I relise that my peers have been doing ti for a while. I will get better and stronger. You should too, every <strong>man</strong> exersices.</p>
<p>Now that I exersiced, what now? I will relax for a bit, cool off you know?</p>
<p>Currently 3:14, I relaxed for a bit. Read like 8 pages, then ate lunch. I ate it rather fast, and then played games. After playing games, my parents said &quot;Stop playing games&quot;. So I went outside with my brother to play soccer, we played for some time. I think 45 minutes, but I was not keeping track. So then while we were playing it started to rain, womp womp. So I came back inside. My brother is getting better, he is bad, but getting better at soccer. I taught him how to run with the ball, I am surprised. Never thought I would acknowledge him being good at something, he is not good at soccer. I will teach him though, my parents are busy with work a lot.</p>
<p>Anyways, I will relax some more. Cool off you know? Relaxing is very tiring, currently 4:16. I just wasted time, I regret doing so very much. A whole hour gone because I wasted time. I will exersice some more, I need to be able to do 20 pushups with no breaks. I will bench my chair 500 times, currently 4:37, done. I did more than 500, I did (more than) 100 one handed, and 400 with both hands. It was fun, I got to do one handed ones. They are pretty easy, nice. I am getting stronger, my hand feels solid. I will relax now, but not waste time.</p>
<p>Currently 5:00-ish, I will study math for an hour and a half. Just opended the blinds, it rained very heavily, wow. My window is just super wet, the grounds are all wet too. I mean this is better than a snowstorm, I like snow, but not when it is freezing. (estimate = sample * population) My computer has no charge, I will charge it then finish the question. Currently 7:00-ish, I watched a oxford mathamatics lecture, it was very intresting about 2d 3d. And how to fold paper, cool, I did that till 6:00. And then I played games till 6:30. And then I talked with my mother what we will do tomorrow, we will go out for donuts in the morning. Then eat chinese food for dinner, nice. Anyways, I will finish writing the problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gerald has 500 oranges, he noticed 2 are rotten. Imagine his rotten # of oranges is proportionate. So if he notices 2 are rotten if his total is 500. Then if he has 60,000 oranges, how many would be rotten? He wonders this and goes to ask his buddy, he gets in his car and drives to a house. He knocks on the door.</p>

<p>Answer the following after reading the passage/text:</p>

I think I got the problem I made wrong. But I do not know. Wrote this warning on March 18th, so optionally read it.</p></div></div>
<p>This was kinda simple, but not really. The answers were: #3, 1/250 or 2/500, 240 oranges, #1, &quot;Me&quot; or you. So #4 because CHECK THE SPELLING. And 1/250 or 2/500 because if you read the question it says &quot;Rotton to normal&quot; so yeah. And 240 oranges because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1:250 . . . 2:500 . . . 4:800 . . . 8 : 1000</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>60000/1000 . . . 60</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8 * 60 . . . 240 oranges</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What does this mean? I found the ratio, then I applied it to the population (total) of 60000. So for every 1000 oranges, there are 8 rotten. So for every = division, so 60000/1000. Sixty is whats left, and since there are sixty 1000&#x27;s, you have to multiply it by 8. Because &quot;for every 1000 there is 8 rotten&quot;, so 60000/1000 * 8. Which is 60*8, which is 240. Get it? If you don&#x27;t spend some time analyising my solution. Or ask someone, anyways, I will continue. The reason the answer is &quot;me&quot; or you, it because if you read my previous questions you should know why. If you haven&#x27;t and you just figured it out, bravo, your smart.</p>
<p>Currently 7:20, I will learn some biology.</p>
<p>Currently around 10:00, I spent two minutes learning biology. I then went downstairs because I heard my dad call/say my name, he did indeed need me. When I went down, my dad asked me to peel some potatoes, I did. After peeling them he asked me to make mashed potatoes, I did. I used salt, potatoe, butter, (some) milk. It was delicious, why? Because it was tasty and good quality. I ate dinner and then watched some Netflix show about living longer. It was amazing, it actually intrested me.</p>

<p>Do these things and you will at minimum feel better, I don&#x27;t think any of these are wrong. Having friends gives you sense of belonging, which is amazing. Being happy just keeps you alive, you know. Don&#x27;t eat till you stuffed, so you don&#x27;t overeat or become overweight. Becoming overweight increases chances of health issues, why? Search it up if you doubt. Eating greens is just great because it makes you feel better in general. Avoid junk food, there are too many calories in there. Too much is bad, applies to anything. Eat food with health benifits just mean, eat healthy greens. Keeping your mind relaxed is great, it protects yourself from lots of things. Run around, dont sit around, get the blood pumping. Sleep, it will make you feel better, trust me. Have a purpose, be it keeping something alive, or doing something like artistic. This gives you something to look forward to, yeah. Pick up gardening, it is fun and is a good light exersice, and relaxing. Avoid less activity, why? It is bad to sit around, why? It is bad for your body, why? You need physical well-being, why? To feel better, why? To live longer, yes. Dont take stress, to be happy, why? It is bad for you, yep. Survive, don&#x27;t do anything too rash or risky. You know what I mean, right?</p>
<p>Anyways, currently 10:30-ish, I will sleep.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-15th-">March 15th 🌱<a href="#march-15th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 15th 🌱" title="Direct link to March 15th 🌱">​</a></h3>
<p>I woke up, got dressed and ready to go. As a family, we went to Tim Hortens.</p>
<p>Currently 9:48, I will continue. So we walked maybe 20-30 minutes to Tim Hortens, then we went inside. We ordered 4 sandwhiches and half a dozen donuts. The quality of the sandwichs was surpirisng, it felt really good quality and tasted nice. It did not feel oily or greesy, but instead tasted great.</p>
<p>The donuts were tasty too, I ate half a donut, we will eat them over a period of time. Anyways, I will relax a bit. Maybe for 12 minutes.</p>
<p>Currently 11:00-ish, I relaxed, then spent time with my family. So at 10:00, I went to spend time with my mom. I spent an hour relaxing with my mother and younger brother. I will do some learning now. Currently 11:30-ish, I spent 30 minutes just listening to music. Wow, anyways, back to work.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>8 : 1000</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>60 * 8 : 60 * 1000 . . . 240 : 60000</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Get it? Well anyways, I will get back to work. It was raining very heavily yesterday, now it is sunny and hot. The weatner in Canada is leaps and bounds more odd than the U.S California weather. Why? I don&#x27;t exactly know. Today is friday, I will relax mostly today.</p>
<p>Quick update, did some things, currently 1:30-ish. Exersiced (did not study after 11:30, just exersiced) then ate lunch, now will head to mall with family.</p>
<p>Currently 4:00, now 4:01. I went to the mall, it was fun. We saw some things, drank Boba Tea, and walked around. I did not get to buy anything, as we were there for &quot;recreational&quot; purposes. I saw this really cool looking toy cop car, it was amazimg, I had to get it. But sadly, it &quot;cost too much&quot;. I have money in my pocket, lots of money. Yet I cannot buy something I want? I could buy a hundred, no <del>three hundred</del> 26-ish toy cop cars if I wanted. But no, I could not buy one.</p>
<p>Yeah, but my parents are right. I was just going to keep it on my desk as like a showcase piece. Shoot, I really wanted it. But it is fine, it is not fine. I still want it, but I cannot get it. So what now? I did not get something I wanted, what now? Am I sad? Kinda, I wanted it. Did I get it? No, but I want it. So what do I do? Forget about it, what did I expect? Go to the mall does not mean you&#x27;ll get anything.</p>
<p>I got some Boba tea, (almost) threw up. That drink had SO much suger my stomach still hurts while writing this. I only drank half of it, yet it (my stomach) hurts. You would think, me being strong and young I would be able to handle a ton of suger. But no, that just hurt my body. Maybe too much suger is bad? Yeah, well anyways, I will study math.</p>
<p>Currently 5:15-ish, I wasted time (did not study math). I spent like 30 minutes just wasting time, I regret it. Yet why don&#x27;t I feel anger or frustration? Because I don&#x27;t regret it, why? Why don&#x27;t I regret just wasting time, did it make me feel good? A little bit yeah, but wasting time is not supposed to make you feel good. Good things are supposed to make you feel good, I regret it, a lot. That was 30 minutes I won&#x27;t get back. I could have exersiced, done anything for that matter. But I wasted time, it was less than worthless, it was a waste. I won&#x27;t, or at least I will try not to waste time, relaxing is good. But wasting time is not good.</p>
<p>Anyways, I will study math. So at like 4:30-ish, I started exersicing, I exersiced and did harder pushups. It was cool, I was sweating. Back to work.</p>
<p>Learned about how studies work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sample studies (study a sample of a population, prone to bias)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obervational studies (observe and study variables and their correlation, a lurking variable could drive both, leading to error in the study)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimental studies (Experiment weather these variables correlate by taking a population and adding more of one variable to half of the population, and more of the other variable to the other half of the population, then see if one is responsible for the other, or if they correlate, this takes away error from the observation study)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Is what I understood, this seems very useful. While reading data I do not care to think if it is biased or unbaised, but you should also care where and how the info got there. Like, did the people plan ahead? Did they censor some data? Did they only take data from a small group of people? Was the data actually random and truthful? Was it scripted or biased? These things are important because you do not want to be tricked.</p>
<p>Currently 6:50-ish, I played some games, and will now finish the questions. I will exersice actually.</p>
<p>Like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Harold woke up one day and decided to ask his friends to tell him they liked him. He asked this to 10 friends, they all said yes as they had been friends for a long time. He then took this data and messaged his best friend, he wrote: &quot;I asked ten people if they liked me, they all said yes&quot;. His best friend was confused, how was this even possible.</p>

<p>Currently 9:37, I exersiced for a while, then ate dinner. I played games before dinner. I ate chicken and noodles for dinner, it was amazing. All homemade-ish.</p>
<p>Methylchloroisothiazolinone</p>
<p>A real word, moving on. So the answers for that were: #1/yes, It was biased etc, 10, *anything*, #2 or #3, #2/no.</p>
<p>Why were these the answers? Yes it is biased, because it is scripted for the friends to say yes, it was planned ahead. I think it was biased because, it was forced. He asked 10 friends of his to say yes to what he will ask, he asked them if they like him, they said yes maybe because he asked them to beforehand. Anything you write for &quot;Would you be his best friend&quot; would be correct, I just put that there as a simple question with no definitive answer. And no, everybody responds, or at least that is what the text says. He asked 10 friends, they all said yes, ALL. Well anyways, if I missed anything, or got anything wrong. Please write below:</p>
<input placeholder="Was it good?">
<p>Anyways, currently 10:06, was reading about carcinogen. It is cancer inducing things, search it up. Smoking, drinking alchohol, and radiation is all bad. Wood/saw dust is also not good, coffee also. Proccesed meats are bad, but I eat them all the time. Everyone does, or at least I think they do. They sell proccesed meats everywhere, but it is bad. So why sell it? To make a profit, yeah.</p>
<p>I will sleep, I brushed. Today at the mall I bought a huge soap bottle for 3 CAD, it was massive. It was vanilla, and was good quality, it had the &quot;long word&quot; Methylchloroisothiazolinone in it. It is pretty good, I like it, the price was great too. Moving on:</p>
<p>I will sleep.</p>

<p>Just woke up, some time ago. Currently around 8:50, I did not sleep very much. In the small sleep I did have however, I had two realistic dreams. Only I can see my dreams, only I can turn them into reality? Anyways, one was about playing soccer with my friends, and another was about:</p>
<p>You are tasked with going to kill the space demons, you get to an human outpost but your ship crashed. A demon lord wonders about whats beyond his galaxy, his solar system. There are like 10 or so demon lords, they are powerful. The demon lord that wonders about whats beyond his galaxy (you came from another galaxy, the human one). There are no aliens, only demons. You go to human outposts, talk, fight the demons, and go to a planet. This planet used to be a human outpost, but is all zombies. Another planet used to be a human outpost, but is now all pychos, and insane cultists who are crazy (and worship the demons). You embark on an emotional journey in both planets. After completing it you do some more quests and find the first demon lord. Gluttony, it is a fat, giant monster. It is spikey and walks on all fours, it is huge. It invaded a military base and called it its home, it isn&#x27;t very smart. You take your bike/car/vehicle and go check out the planet it took. As you were investigating you stumble across the remains of a human outpost. Twenty seven B, it is on a hill. At the very top is this outpost, and in the center is a big military building. You go check it out, you hide while going up. There could be demons, so you slowly go up there. There are no demons though, right? Well once you get to the top you see a demonic monster resting. It is small but takes up the entire warehouse. The demon lords are celestial beings in human eyes, they posses the power of stars, yet they vary between strength. This one has consumed planets but no stars, you stand no chance still.</p>
<p>As you attmept to wake it up without getting killed, it wakes up. You cannot kill it alone, but you can kill it with a trap. Harbingers, giant cannons in the sky. They cannot rotate, they are static, once set in place they cannot move. So you have to lure the demon lord of gluttony there. You hop on the bike/car/vehicle and drive down the hill with the lord behind you charging. You dodge crates and giant walls, debris and falling structures. You get a message saying the Harbinger isn&#x27;t ready, some technical difficulties happened. You panic, but become calm. You find a lever near the base of a wall, this lever closes a emergency door. The emergency doors are huge walls made from angelium. Angeluim is a material crated from the essence of demons/monsters. It repels demons, contrary to the name there is nothing angelic about it. It is the blood and remains of demons mad e into a metal, this strong scent of death repels them. You dodge its sweeping tail and flip the lever. The door closes on it, your safe. It goes quiet for a second, growls could be heard. All of a sudden a peircing roar could be heard. It is mad, you taunt it with thr blood of the fallen. The fallen is another name for the demons. They sometimes fall from the sky and destroy cities of human outposts. You start running away, with it at your helm you can only pray they have the harbinger up and running. You lead it to the designated spot by sheer effort, you ride off cliff and discard your vehicle in the procces. It jumps off too, you parachute and watch it fall on the marked spot. A blue light shown on the lord, it looks up like a deer in the headlights. A second later a BOOM, where the light eluminated was burnt. The lord, left only bones and tinged flesh. It&#x27;s core is visible. A lords core is used to create harbingers, you need the force of a planet or a sun to kill a lord. Depending on how much it has consumed of the universe.</p>
<p>You go back on the ship, Rectify is its name. The camander praises you, but a thought comes up. Why am I doing all this? Isn&#x27;t there anyone else who can do this? Why was I chosen? You push those thoughts aside as your friend with a broken arm cheers with you. It was a grand party, but you coulden&#x27;t shake something was off. Why you were the only one fighting these battles, wasn&#x27;t clear. Were you a half-demon? Did they put something inside you when you were little? Or was it just dumb luck you were chosen to kill a lord. A celestial being many never lay their eyes on, be it a weak one. A lord is a lord, this one however wasn&#x27;t the brightest. You join the festivities and relax. Days, weeks pass. You remember the times you subdued zombies, cultists, and defeated countless demons. That was probably the reason, your a proffessinal at this.</p>
<p>A warning comes in, the alrams blare. A cosmic disturbace is happening, a cosmic disterbance is where space undergoes drastic changes. Such as the birth or death of a star. Was a star going to supernove? You check with the camander, he points at the message recieved. An outpost, Centary Alpha, is under attack. A wave of demons horded and fell from the sky. The demons can walk in space, they evolved longer than humans have. They can just walk to another planet, but we cannot. The cammander says we need to help, there are mega-cities on that planet. Billions of lives will be lost if we waste time, you have to go. We warp to sector 3, one of the first sectors esatblished as demon free. But what was happening, did the demons plan this? In the old days, gen 1, they never thought up stratigies, they only attacked blindly. You come to the relisation that a lord could be controlling them, how else do you cammand tons of legions of demons. You take a crew and depart off the ship. As you head down to the planet, a BOOM could be heard, the ship was under attack. Do you choose to save the ship and you commander? Or the billions of people down below.</p>
<p>If you chose to help the ship, you would be found guilty of breaking the commandments of a slayer. The camandments are rules and laws the slayers (you) need to follow. You would be killed if you went back to the ship.</p>
<p>If you chose to save the people down below you would continue with your crew. While mourning the people on the ship, you keep going further down. You prepare to fight. A battle ensues, your team ges wiped out, the citizens are dying one after the other. The demons take over, the sight it gruesome, the slayers are being pushed back. As all is lost, you get stabbed by a demon, your friend kills it. He takes you and pushes you away, a demon explodes, along with your friend. You then battle some more and manage to secrure the planet. Millions have died, slayers, citizens. When all was lost you still won. But you will never forget the battle, such as any other.</p>
<p>You stand there looking at the battle feild, it used to be a city. A ship decends, it seems familier, vitality. The ship that was battling along side the rectify. If they were near rectify, did vitality save rectify. Could the commander be alive? You go on board and ask what happened. They say that they managaed to save some of the crew, but sadly the commander died. You remeber that h alsways use to say that a captain goes down with his ship. He died a glorious death. You sit down and the ship warps back to the central slayer base. You havent been there in a while, this gives you a chance to stock up on reasources and ammo. You get some things, learn some new skills and head on a ship to a human outpost near a forest of hills.</p>
<p>The things you learned from the central base were useful as you are now stronger. You also feel prepared, the ship takes off. You are headed to a human outpost that got wiped out, by what is still unclear. The planet it is on is mostly mountains and hills. You warp there, it takes a long time since it is very far away. SWHOOOOUUUP, you get there. As it lands you see smoke in the distance. Survivors? You go take a look, there are survivors, you ask what happened. They saw a flue caught about, the illness spread and killed many slayers and citizens. They are the only ones alive, you go check the camp. Everyone is dead, the bodies are snow white, they have a frosty apearence. You are sickened, had there ever been such a bad desiese? A comrade that came along passes out masks to sheild from infection. You gladly take one, as you roam around you notice an eye looking at you. It twitches then blinks, you yell for a medic. They come and take the body, you know they wont survive. But using their body they can make a cure.</p>
<p>As you venture deeper into the infected zones, you notice something, a white color in the air. You ask your comrades if they can see it, they deny. You wonder if being around demons has given you power? The power demons have comes from planets are stars, being around and killing them could have givin you powers. You follow the white trail in the air, you ask the others to follow suite. You see the white get stonger and more visible, you reach a mountain. You go inside and see lots of white in the air, a temple of sorts is built here. So far in the mountains and hills there is a temple? The only reason you found this is because you can see a trail leading to it. You had to cross rivers, hills, and other things to get here. Did the camp people make it? No, they couldn&#x27;t possibly, the writing on the walls was strange. As a comrade tries to read it, CHOKE, they star choking. One after the other your comrades choke to death, the white in the air had such a strong smell to them.Yet why couldn&#x27;y you smell it? You panic, they all die. You drag their bodies outside the cave in the mountain and light a flare, you did this a safe distance away from the smell. You continue further into the strange temple, statues of strange creatures, markings. You notice one that is grand, you take out your tool that shows how old something is. It says this temple is thousands of years old. But how? You are puzzled but continue, a massive room is visible.</p>
<del><p>You walk in and notice a gaping hole in the ground. It is the size of the mountain range. It extends as far as the eye can see, the hole imeasurable in size.</p><p>You decide to jump in, you open your parachute and light a flare. But this time you hold onto it to use as a light source, you did not bring a flashlight. You start to see a silluete, whats there? The hole slowly expands, and expands. The once imeasurable hole has gotten ten time as big. What could be down there? After an hour you land, you&#x27;ve landed on a rock surface. The rock has detailed carvings and patterns. You see a light in the far far distance. You run there hoping to find out what your standing on. The light is comes from a crack in the floor. You walk there and see a cliff, the rock surface ends. This doesn&#x27;t make any sense. You are standing on a giant rectangle? The crack reveals a hollow area. The rectangle you are on is hollow. What could be inside?</p></del>
<p>The massive room is as big as the mountain range. You walk in and see a silluete of bones, could is be an enourmous carcass? But what could be that big? A lord? But as far as you know there are 10 lords left. Did one die? And how? You walk closer and use the tool to see how old it is. It says it is 100,000 years old. It shows that number then glitches out, error. How old is this thing? It is really old, but how? Could this be the Ancient Lord talked about in demon mythology. You notice a white light coming from the top of the carcass of bones and rotten flesh. You use your jet pack to fly up there, you see a tree. It is a tree as big as a ten story building. It is a mgnificent white with glowing white leaves. You wonder where it is growing from, you take a look. You see the Anceint lords core, it is as big as the core of a planet. It took you a while to zoom here by jetpack, you think of how many planets and suns it has ate. It would have had to consume every single sun and planet in the galaxy to get this big. It isn&#x27;t called anceint for nothing, the power eminating from the core shakes you. The tree burns in your eyes, some of its leaves fall. As they fall they dissapate into white wisps in the air, this is where the white in the air was coming from. Had it made it&#x27;s way into the camp? Is that why they all died? You wonder and take a couple leaves in a jar. They turn into powder, but don&#x27;t become wisps, you added water. You didn&#x27;t know why, but you just knew to do that.</p>
<p>You leave the mountain and get the bodies of your comrades. You tell about what happened to the grand marshal, the slayer king. He is the one who tells commands to the commanders.</p>
<p>Five years go by, they found a cure for the ancient pale diseases, APD. Lame name, but you don&#x27;t care. You visit the graves of the comrades you had with you in the expedition to the resting place of the Anceint lord. You give one last flower, then change into battle gear. You get prepared to go back to that place. The reasearchers found cures and gave the thumbs up to go. You head there. Once you get there, you stare at the tree. It is beutiful, during these past five years, you have just been battling the demons. You help the scients take samples, you never mention your resistence to the APD.</p>
<p>They take the samples back to the labs, they find that the white powder is pure essance. It is almost anglelic, it is named angle dust. It is used to kill demons more efficiently, it unlike bullets, melts the demons. So one cm^2 of it is enough to kill or almost entirely melt a demon. But the supply is not infinite. They find out that they can put some angel dust on demon cores, and that little plants sprout. This ground breakind discovery is great. The humans will have a better fighting chance. You get an upgrade in gear, the bullets are now coated in angel dust, you are also given grenades that contain angel dust.</p>
<p>You get your name writen as the one who found angel dust. You are praised and rise to a commander, as a cammander you have more duties.</p>
<p>Five more years pass, you defeated demons, wiped legions, and saved many planets. They sent out another voyage, voyage 67. You were part of voyage 63. There have been 67 voyages to this galaxy. Why this one? This one has the most amount of habitibale planets in it s galaxy. But demons were a big pain. You are the aleins to them, but it is how it is. You and your team set out for another cosmic distarbance. A catagory 1, a demon lord is absorbing the sun of a solar system. Normally this wouldent be too much of an issue, but the solar system has human inhabitants. You prepare for another battle, but now, you are a commander.</p>
<p>You set out on a battle, the demon lord was identified as jealousy, a cosmic being that ranks in the top five strongest lords. The only way to kill him is with an angelic harbinger, harginger with angel dust as the combustion meckanisim. This one is snkae like and can slither through space. Its mouth is like a vaccume, it can devour a sun in a year. During this time it is most vunerable. It has been indentified to have eaten over 200 planets and 10 suns. It has grown in length so much that it exccededs the length of the Anceint lord. But its width however is very minimal, only about 50 miles. It is fast and hard to kill. You set out to kill it.</p>
<p>After an intense battle in space, you wound it. A year has passed, and all you and everyone else has managed was cutting of it&#x27;s tail. The lord of jealously left the sun alone, as it was too much hassle to deal with the humans. You celebrate but know that they could easily kill them.</p>
<p>What are lords? What are demons? Demons are like humans, only they consumed the dark matter of the universe. Lords are the demons who evolved after eating a planets core, they are demons who were extremly powerful. Leagion bosses, but became lords by devouring their planets cores and sacrificing the leagions they command. They are all powerful.</p>
<p>After the battle with the lord of jealousy you have become the most decorated commander in the human race. You rejoice but know that there are still 9 demons lords left. Another could be made anytime, so you decide to talk to the grand marshal. You tell about how you need to conqour the demon planets to stop new lords from being born. He agrees but questions the morals of the situiation, the demons are like humans. You assure him this is the right choice.</p>
<p>You go off to battle, a couple years passed by, the demons have been pushed back. The demon lords don&#x27;t care about their race, only themselves. That is how they became lords in the first place. You are at the helm of this conquest.</p>
<p>Another 10 years pass, you are 50 now, you have grown a beard and have seen war for too long. The voyage is now at 71. Back on earth they sing praises of you, yet you don&#x27;t sing any for yourself. You are a hero in war, but war is war. Killing is killing, death is death. You have managed to kill 9 demon lords now, each one giving you a new power. The first giving you the power to see angel dust wisps, the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eigth, and ninth giving you all new powers. The third gave you a demonic eye, it lets you see farther. The seventh gave you a heart of darkness, it heals you slowly, like regeneration. You have killed countless demons now.</p>
<p>The final battle is near, the time has come to kill the last demon. The lord of pride, this demon lord wonders about whats beyond his galaxy. He has pride in his own, but has slowly started to envy the other galaxy. The lord is conflicted, he holds everything of his own in high regard, but that has slowly slipped away. All thanks to you, you have diminished his pride as a demon, his pride in his galaxy, and his pride in his own ability. He wants to kill you. The lord of Pride is the most human like of all the lords. He can change his form freely, he can make one part of his body bigger than the other, and vice versa. He has consumed 1000 planets and 57 suns, the most powerful of all lords, and the smartest. He does anything for his own gain and benift. If it makes him feel better, more prideful, he will kill you.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve grown old fighting the demons, yet the final battle is around the corner. Do you have what it takes?</p>
<p>Voyage 63</p>
<hr>
<p>OK, so, I spent a good three hours writing this. I am very happy with it, please do not copy this, I do not want you to take this. DO NOT, I reapet, DO NOT STEAL OR COPY THIS. This was what I dreamt about, it was detailed and I was fully immerssed. So yeah, this is my dream.</p>
<p>Moving on, currently 12:40. I will eat lunch.</p>
<p>Currently 1:17, I ate lunch. It was amazing, chicken. I will study some math now. Currently 2:00-ish, I studied on my balcony about how to know if studies or experiments are causation or correlation. Like is something cause by something else? Or is something correlating to something.</p>
<p>Like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Richard went to the mall, he noticed that there was a sign that said. &quot;Take sample for free&quot;, it was a candy shop giving out free samples. He asked them if they could run an experiment, they said yes. They measured on which days do they give out the most samples. The data showed on fridays there was the most, follwed up by wednesday. The one where there was the least was on monday. Richard wondered why, so he asked a friend of his.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You are the friend, help Richard by solving the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What were the samples they were giving?</p>
<input type="radio" id="q_13_e" name="answer13" value="13">
<label for="q_13_e">Soap</label>
<input type="radio" id="13__e2" name="answer13" value="13">

<label for="q_13_e4">Perfume</label>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What if I told you that they had less samples on monday to give out? Would the data change?</p>
<input type="radio" id="q_14_e" name="answer14" value="14">
<label for="q_14_e">Yes, the data would change</label>
<input type="radio" id="14__e2" name="answer14" value="14">
<label for="q_14_e2">No, the data would not change</label>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What if the person handing out the samples was rude? Would the data change?</p>
<input type="radio" id="q_15_e" name="answer14" value="15">
<label for="q_15_e">Yes, rudeness would affect the data</label>
<input type="radio" id="15__e2" name="answer14" value="15">
<label for="q_54_e2">No, rudeness would not affect the data</label>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does the type of person handing out the samples matter?</p>
<textarea cols="30" rows="5"></textarea>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If on wednesday 70% of the people in the mall took samples, and 1000 people came to the mall that day. Then how many people got samples on wednesday?</p>
<input type="number" step="10">
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On friday 800 came to the mall, and the person giving it out was a very nice and attractive male. The average people that take samples in the mall is 30%. If the person is polite and nice that percentage raises by 20%. If the person who is giving it is attractive it increases depending on if they are male of female. If it is a male it increases by 40%, if it is female, it increases by 20%. People are more shy in front of a pretty girl, they dont wanna be made fun of either. A handsome male will be approached by more because the boyfriend of a girl will be by them. But if a boyfriend goes to the female sample giver, there might be some misunderstandings. Being attractive attracts everyone, but a pretty girl could be used in a social experiment. People could be made fun of online for being weird and staring. SO, how many people came to the mall on friday?</p>
<input type="number" step="10">
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So on wednesday, what kind of person gave out the samples? (HINT: THINK)</p>
<input placeholder="A ___ who is ____ and a _____">
</blockquote>
<p>After you finished, I will give the answers: Candy/#2, Yes/#1, Yes/#1, *anything*, 700, 720, A polite and attractive female.</p>
<p>Alright, why were these the answers? It is a candy shop giving out the samples, so obviously they would give out candy. If they had less samples on monday that would change the data, if they had the same amount of samples as the other days they could have gotten a better score. And yes, a person being rude would drive away samples takers/customers. So it is base 30%, then being polite increases by 20%, so 50% so far. And then because she is attractive it increase by 20%, this leads to 70%. Get it? Yeah.</p>
<p>Anyways, I will finish my art homework. It is saturday today and I don&#x27;t know my schedule for monday. Yeah, well I will finish it. Currently 3:03, I just relaxed and read a little. I spent maybe 10 minutes doing that, so now I will do the artwork.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr47-06ca295223cb608bab38290cf7ce27b1.png" width="2072" height="4608" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Screenshot of my artwork</em></p>
<p>Currently 4:15, I made some progress. It looks nice, I colored the sun and made the person better. I know, I know, the picture is not great. But I don&#x27;t know how to make it look better. So, I will add pink leaves to the tree branchs the next time I draw.</p>
<p>Currently 4:40, I relaxed for some time by showing my dad my drawing. He said he liked it, I will exersice now.</p>
<p>Currently 6:30, some dogs are fighting, their owners are watching. The dogs are punching each other, how? They just are. Anyways, I exercised for about an hour. Then ate food. I will do something now. By the way, the owners are very smart, watchiing their dogs fight. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, maybe they are play fighting? Back to work.</p>
<p>The dogs are tired and decide to stop, never mind. They are running around chasing each other, they look like they are biting each other. I CANNOT tell, if they are play fighting or real fighting. Back to work.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>With light, you can make Oxygen, ATP, and NADPH in photosynthesis</li>
<li>To break the bonds of water molecules light energy is used</li>
<li>How do we fix inorganic carbon? We use ATP and NADPH to make it into organic molecules (like glucose)</li>
</ul>
<p>So the first two are dependant on light, and the last one is not dependant on light. ATP, adenosine tri-phosphate. And ADP, adenosine di-phosphate. I don&#x27;t think I spelled it right. In photosynthesis, the clorophylast produces water which causes the oxygen in the water to break 0ff anf float out. That is why plants create oxygen? Im not sure.</p>
<p>Anyways, I will now sleep.</p>
<p>Currently 9:30, didn&#x27;t sleep. I just fixed some things and asked a friend to help me out. Now I&#x27;ll sleep.</p>

<p>St.Patricks day, wow. So, this morning I relaxed then finished learning HTML. I will move to doing something else now. I will look at what bootstrap is, it seems useful. But I don&#x27;t think I would use it, it looks spesific and hard. You should go search it up, maybe I&#x27;m wrong.</p>
<p>Currently 10:10, I ate breakfeast. I woke up at like 7:30, slept till 8:30, then wasted time till 9:00. And then studied a little till 9:15-ish. Then wasted tim till 9:30, then ate beakfeast. I regret it. Moving on I will study some more.</p>
<p>So, server rooms cost money. And mainting them costs even more. So somone invented the cloud (managed servers). Why take the hassle of maintaining a server? Let someone else do it for you! And pay by how much the server is used. After all, they have rooms of racks and rows of servers. They have space, you need space. Pay and remove that cost. The bigger your website, the more data is stored and used. So where do you put that data? In servers of course, and where are servers put? In server rooms, so where are server rooms? In buildings, but that costs money. So yeah, just let the cloud handle it.</p>
<p>Front end, the look and feel. Back end, the funtionallity and how the front works. The middle man that takes querries from the front end and does some data functionality with the back end is super important. See front end plus back end is full stack.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ui</li>
<li>Interactive elements</li>
<li>Styling</li>
<li>Services</li>
<li>Physical/virtual servers</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all part of a website. The front end makes the site look good, the back end makes it work good. Anyways, currently 3:32, I went to walmart. I bought some things, among them I bought a 10lbs weight. It is blue and is pretty cool, it weighs a lot. It feels heavy, I need to be stronger.</p>
<p>I will work out. Currently 4:00-ish. I spent some time working out with the weight. I did many different exersices. Currently 4:15, I have just been listening to music. I will study some math now, some SAT prep.</p>
<p>Currently 6:30, I wasted time till 5:00. I then spent 30 minutes with my family. And then challenged my brother to: &quot;Who can finish the game Light Bot first for $2&quot;. I of course won, finishing it in 15 minutes. I read the reviews of people saying they finished it in one sitting, I didn&#x27;t believe them, but it was true. It was so easy, but I am 13. I am not a not smart.. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th grader who the app is meant for. But give it a try, it is fun.</p>
<p>I will just relax, I have school starting again and my one week break is over. It is a day 4 tomorrow. Currently 8:22, I played games till around 7:30 (?). And then I exersiced till like 8:05-ish. After that I relaxed till 8:20, I will draw (my artwork). Never mind, I will eat dinner. I only drew for like 15 minutes. Added flowers, so yeah.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-18th-">March 18th ✅<a href="#march-18th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 18th ✅" title="Direct link to March 18th ✅">​</a></h3>
<p>Woke up, took a shower. Prepped my bag in the morning becuase I wanted to get some sleep last night. I then went to school, it went good. I will study math now. I forgot to show the picture of my final product, here it is:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr48-3a12ca4b71672ff4696e57fcff9d0233.jpg" width="3024" height="4032" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This is not the final product, I forgot to take a picture of it. All I did was add a clear light-blue sky, nothing special. It would like the same but with a tint of blue in the white areas on the final product. I will relax for a little then study math.</p>
<p>Currently 5:15, I wasted time for a bit, I regret it. I also messed around with the 10lbs weight, it is good. I will study now, math SAT prep. Currently 6:10, I played games for some time then studied for a bit. I am at 16% in SAT prep KhanAcedemy, it is very cool, a lot of these topics are just 9th grade math problems, it is not hard. I did this stuff in 8th grade, I signed up for double math, the name itself is explanation enough. So anyways, what now? I will exersice for a bit, did not</p>

<p>Currently 7:05, just relaxed and ate cantalope. Now I&#x27;ll exersice, this time for sure. Currently 7:45, I exersiced then wasted time for 5-10 minutes. I fully accept that I wasted time for like 10 minutes at the end, I did however get a good workout. I can do 20 pushups without much difficulty, it is amazing. I am astounded by my own improvment, do it every day and you will see results. I exerice like 2-3 hours a day, sometimes only 1 hour. I like exersicing, it makes me feel confident. But now-a-days I am not being truthful to myself. Dang, 7:55, I am so tired. I&#x27;m super sleepy, want rest. I will study some biology then eat dinner, then relax. I need to first do the things before writing about them.</p>
<p>I am a fool, by writing something down here the chances of me doing them either drop or increase, now-a-days they drop. When they increase is when I have a clear goal of what I need to do, my goals get intruded by distractions and useless thoughts. I <del>will</del> have to do better.</p>
<p>Im trying to understand photosynthesis, here are some notes, they could be right or wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li>The energy is more when breaking the bonds, and is stored as chemical energy. It is more than the energy used to form the bond.</li>
<li>The chemical reactions in photosynthesis produce, not glucose, but oxygen and ATP &amp; NADPH</li>
<li>NADP+ is produced without light, but NADPH is with light</li>
<li>Glucose and ADP are also produced with no light</li>
<li>Oxygen, ATP, and NADPH are produced with light</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide plus oxygen is glucose and oxygen</li>
<li>Energy is consumed not released when bonds are broken</li>
<li>Energy is used to break bonds</li>
<li>Energy is released in the formation of new bonds, energy is released not consumed</li>
<li>Oxygen is relased not removed from the enviornment</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide and water make suger in photosynthesis</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide is used to make glucose, glucose is suger</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently 8:15, the time flew, but I spent it nonetheless. It was good enough, but has to be better.</p>
<p><em>Next day, ate dinner then slept.</em></p>

<p>Warning: What I&#x27;m gonna say is a bit un-kid-friendly</p>
<hr>
<p>We had rock climbing today, I went to school and then played soccer and came back home. So I woke up, showered a little, then walked to school. I then did some things and school ended, I became a therapist, do not laugh. Being a therapist is a job where you talk to people about serious matters. One guy I was talking to wanted to reconcile and apologise to someone he was rude to, he feels it has been awkward between them and wants to change it. I asked him what he has in mind, we chatted then he asked me to help him. I was about to help him, when he chickened out, he said &quot;shhhh&quot;. So when I was not looking they got in an argument, he said some things, they said some things. He then said, &quot;Im done, Im done with them.&quot; It went poorly, I told him, &quot;you are calm, you are happy&quot;. He surprisingly became calm, he then said he is done with them, they have not been a good friend in the past. So I decided to help him, by supporting him, remaining neutral. Therapists are supposed to be unbiased, and neutral, I told him to be peaceful. He then reconciled, he said it went good. I think it worked, so yeah, I am happy for him.</p>
<p>So another guy, Caleb, I play soccer with him. He is my classmate, Caleb came to me to talk about something. He told me something about his cousin, she died from a drug overdose. She wasn&#x27;t like a drug addict, someone put something in her drink and she drank it. In an instant she passed out and.. Yeah, when I heard this I thought. &quot;Thats a homicide&quot;, he thinks so too, he believes her boyfriend did it. Caleb was close with her, she was best friends with Caleb. Her newborn baby died some time ago, and now her. She went to a cancert and had her drink tampered with, she was in the very back. There were 8000 people at the concert, no one would notice one person missing/passed out. There is security in the front, cameras in the front. None in the back, but still, thats messed up. Homicide, murder, is just.. killing. She was probably in a rough patch with.. you know, and now this happens. Life can be cruel, no, painful.</p>
<p>You know, walking back home after I got dropped off. I had an imagination that someone will drive by and shoot me, like a drive-by shooter. I was like &quot;nahh, stop thinking dumb thoughts&quot;. Just then a car drove by, I saw what looked like a gun being pointed with a camera on top of it. Like is he gonna record shooting someone? But I didn&#x27;t get shot, I mean it could be my mind playing tricks on me. But I saw a camera, and something that looked like a g-u-n. I dunno, but she was 20, why did she... why did that happen to her? Who does this? It&#x27;s so messed up, &quot;this is what the world has come to&quot; said my friend.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now I&#x27;m gonna be paranoid, as I should be. But for now, I will do something. Currently 6:15, I just ate an orange. So after school ended, my friend Caleb asked if we could play soccer, I said yeah. I then asked my other friend Hiro if he wanted to come, he said yes, but he needed permission from his parents. I asked Caleb if he could drive by Hiro&#x27;s house to get permission, we went there and got permission. Anthoney said he coulden&#x27;t go, so yeah. Hiro, Caleb, and I headed to the soccer feild. Caleb&#x27;s father was driving us there, we got there, went in. And then started playing, it was a lot of fun. The hour passed by quick, lot of fun though. We then drove back, I got down at Hiro&#x27;s house then walked home, that was when &quot;that&quot; happened. He lives down the street from me, amazing, we can walk to highschool together. Anyways, I will do something now, currently 6:30.</p>
<p>Currently 7:05, wasted time, couldn&#x27;t exersice as my hamstrings and legs were sore from playing soccer. I just wasted time, 30 minutes down the drain, dang. I am learning about &quot;Factoring quadratic and polynomial expressions foundations&quot;, it isn&#x27;t very hard. It just looks hard but is simple, you just need to know how it works and apply either a formula, or an understanding to break down the problem.</p>
<p>So: This is probably wrong, I am still figuring out this whole quadratic equation thing, these are just notes. They are probably wrong.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the expression 6x<sup>2</sup> + 12x - 10 = 5</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Solve for x</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>6x<sup>2</sup> + 12x - 10 = 2(3x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 5)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6x<sup>2</sup> + 12x - 10 = 5</p>
<ul>
<li>6 = a</li>
<li>12 = b</li>
<li>10 = c</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>6 * 10 . . . 60 . . . (4 * 15) . . . -4 &amp; 15</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(6x - 4)(6x + 15) . . . (3x - 2)(2x + 5)</p>
<ul>
<li>3x - 2 = 0 . . . 3x = 2 . . . x = 2/3</li>
<li>2x + 5 = 0 . . . 2x = -5 . . . x = -5/2</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets see if this is correct:</p>
<ul>
<li>6x<sup>2</sup> + 12x - 10 = 0</li>
<li>6(2/3)<sup>2</sup> + 12(2/3) - 10 = 0<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>4<sup>2</sup> + 8 . . . 16 + 8 . . . 24</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I watched a video by PreMath, really useful. It started out normal but then became like &quot;O my gosh&quot; smart, it was very informative, like I watched 3 other videos about quadratic equations. They explained basic stuff, but this video was amazing, blew my mind. I was flabberghasted, that good. But anyways, I will keep learning</p>
<p><em>Next day, did some things then slept.</em></p>

<p>It is march 20, so yeah. I went to school, and something happened. As the recces was ending, I saw my friend get manhandled by some fat guy, he was 5,8-ish. My friend was struggling, I ran over and pushed the guy doing this to him, I got him to let go. Some talking later I shoved him and he and his 5,9 friend walked off. Later when school ended, a buddy of mine said there was some gossip about him getting jumped (beaten up by a group of people). So I went to find and help him, I found him and called him. I put my hand around his shoulder and told him &quot;your with me today&quot;. I do not want him to get hurt, he is a great guy. Someone is angry he said the N-word, he said he did not say it. I believe him, he said he said &quot;snicker&quot;, not the N-word. We ran into the people he had a problem with, I was with him the whole time. I knew I could take any one of them, they didn&#x27;t want to fight, neither did I. They just wanted to mess around with him, I did not let them. I mean we&#x27;re kids, we don&#x27;t have that bad intention, in canada. I mean I don&#x27;t wanna fight either, over something a simple apology can fix. So I asked my friend to apologise, he said he already did, they said he didn&#x27;t. One of them said &quot;Lets jump him, I&#x27;ll record&quot;, he really said that. I was not gonna let them do that, so I just stood my ground, so then one of them just left. So then the other decided to ask for an apology, he did not apologise, he said &quot;I already did&quot;, so the other guy said &quot;I accept your apology&quot; while walking away.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m glad it ended in him safe, me included. It was kinda fun, that feeling of danger. I don&#x27;t like fighting, but I enjoy the rush? The adrenaline, it... Never mind. The risks outweigh anything, like &quot;street cred&quot;. None of that matters, only safety. Too many things could go wrong, you could very well be fighting someone with a knife. But anyways, I will do something.</p>
<p>Currently 5:30, spent some time deciding on what I&#x27;m gonna paint, so I signed up to paint a peice that&#x27;ll go on auction at my school. I want to draw a globe with a hand holding it. I want another hand to be holding a lighter to the world. I don&#x27;t have any paint at my house, but I will get some.</p>
<p>Currently 6:00, I relxed with my family, and will now do something. Everyone blames each other for the worlds problems, but whose fault is it? 6:45, will exersice. I have a clear plan of what I wanna do. Now 7:35, I exersiced, not too hard. I did some pushups and yeah, I will do something now. These days the days feels shorter, why? Why do the days feel so short? Because it is not a full day, I go to school, then do something at home. I have time to do things, I would prefer if a day was longer.</p>
<p><em>Next day, slept.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-21st-">March 21st 🍎<a href="#march-21st-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 21st 🍎" title="Direct link to March 21st 🍎">​</a></h3>
<p>So I went to school, I had a presentation.</p>
<p>During the day, in recces my friend who I stood up for yesterday came up to me and said, &quot;I need to tell you something&quot;. He told me that no one has ever stood up for him like I did, he said it has always been him (and only himself). He also thanked me for being a real friend, &quot;your a real friend you know&quot;. That makes me happy, he also shared his kit-kat with me, it tasted good. This is why I like being a good person, with strength comes responsibility. My teacher told me that I&#x27;m an old soul, she is not the first teacher to tell me that. Should I be happy or sad? My classmates say I look 20 or 30. I am 13 years, and my aunt joked about me looking older than my parents. I guess it&#x27;s a good thing, looking older is better than looking like a baby. Anyways, I will continue.</p>
<p>So in Drama class I decided to tell my friend that we should do a musical piece for our assignment (making a small film using an aside [/a part where a character says something to the audience]) so I recommened we do a song. And then one of us says &quot;I dont know what I&#x27;m doing&quot; into the camera when the song ends. It will be fantastic, trust me. After that, I had some classes, and then it was time for my presentation. I first set up, then put on my leather jacket, the other time I wore it was a while ago, but today I wore it. I wore it because you get extra marks for dressing as the person you are speaking about. So my presentation was about black history month, I talked about a person named John Ware. He was pretty cool, so I decided to do a presentation on him. It went well, so well the whole class laughed and one guy got up and left. The slides weren&#x27;t funny, what I was saying wasn&#x27;t supposed to be funny, but the way I presented it was.. Like &quot;Imagine your wife dies, then you go get yourself killed&quot;, the class started chuckling. It is not supposed to be funny, but the fact I said such a serious thing straight faced made it seem like I was joking or telling a joke. I was not, but I guess slavery and getting whipped is funny? Maybe it is my fault I used a lot of stickmen, maybe that looked funny. But anyways, we had a good laugh, a good time, someone said it was the highlight of their day. Like 70% of the class are presenting about people for the black history month project. Why we are presenting it so late is beyond me, but my presentation went well. I am happy.</p>
<p>For the past week, my mother has packed an apple every day. I enjoy eating them, so yeah. I will do something now. Tried updating the favicon, didn&#x27;t work. So, lately it has been snowing, so much so I think sometimes it can be considered a blizzard. Right now it is not snowing, but yesterday, and the day before it was snwoing so much I was getting blown away by the wind and snow. I thought it would be sunny but no, it is not, it used to be hot a week or two ago, but now it isn&#x27;t. My birthday is coming up soon, so yeah, I will do something now. Maybe exersice or something.</p>
<p>Currently 6:20, I exersiced, I did 5 pushups for every potato chip I ate. I filled a bowl, I got through half of the bowl till my right arm couden&#x27;t do any more pushups. I will relax a little.</p>
<p>Currently 7:40, I relaxed a little, and while relaxing my mother gave me a package thst arrived at our door. It was components to build a toy car, it had motors, gears, and other things. I was looking forward to it, it arrived the day after I bought it, cool. So I spent an hour messing around, my dad showed me how to make a toggle on off switch system work. I thought that was pretty cool. I will relax a little more.</p>
<p>Currently 8:30, wasted time little, so I did 20 pushups, it is getting too easy. I need to up the number, moving on, I started doing weights. My parents bought me a 10lb weight, so now I am using it, I have mentioned this previously as well. So...</p>
<p><em>Next day, ate food and did things, slept</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-22nd-">March 22nd 🔺<a href="#march-22nd-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 22nd 🔺" title="Direct link to March 22nd 🔺">​</a></h3>
<p>I went to school and came back, my dad drove me home.</p>

I feel like tomorrow there will be snow up to my knees. I am surpirsed by this, spring has started, why is it snowing so... So much.</p></div></div>
<p>So today I went to school, did some things, and had fun. I also ate so many fruits, I am happy. I like my classmates, I am also hungry. I will eat while doing some work. Currently 5:40, just wasted time, I learned something though. I will continue to do something. I did 20 differnt pushups, that are more core strength. I also found out another type of pushup, it looks dumb, but is effective in making my chest burn.</p>
<p>Currently 6:30, did some thinking, checked out some sites my dad reccomended. I read &quot;Take Ownership of Your Future Self
by Benjamin Hardy August 28, 2020&quot;, it is correct. I didn&#x27;t even know the things I was doing were correct, I tell my friends often &quot;Im gonna be a scientist!&quot; I wanna be one, so I told my friends. I know that the guy I was a year ago is very different from me in the present. I know the person I will be in the future will be strong, commanding, and a great person. Everything in the text is correct, I used to shy in 6th grade, then I told myself I&#x27;m not. It worked, I have become the most social and outgoing person I know. I used to be jealous of that one person who&#x27;s so outgoing, but I am now scocial. I enjoy being social, I enjoy talking with people, it gives me knowledge of the world outside my own. When you talk to a person, you exchange information, all information is information, and all information is valuable. If you get false information, then identify it as false, you learned something valuable. Small talk is where someone gets to know you, you get to know them, and then you become friends after a certain level of spoken words have been said. This is how it works, when you think about someone if they are your friend or not. &quot;Have I talked to them as of late? And if so was it meaningful or personal, enough where I could trust them as a friend?&quot; This is how it is in my mind, it might not be the same for everyone, but as I am also a human. I believe that we are all the same. We become different, we start the same. And then are given different chances, lives, circumstances. You might be delt good hand by life, or not. If you are reading this, that means you have been given a better hand than most. That means me inculded, I am not poor. I am not rich, I am rich compared to poor, but poor compared to rich.</p>
<p>So if 0 is poor and 100 rich:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am &gt; 0</li>
<li>I am &lt; 100</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you understand? I&#x27;m sure if you read the scentance previously you&#x27;d understand. But anyways, I will continue looking at things my dad sent me. So viruses make ATP, which is neccesary for living beings. Virus is much smaller than bacteria. So virion is a functional virus, it can infect. All viruses have capsides, the capsomeres are what the capside is made of. The capside is to protect the DNA/RNA or whatever information the virus has. So I thinks virus is what makes you sick, anx virion is what infects to make you sick? I could be wrong though, moving on it is 7:00.</p>
<p>Currently 9:30, did some stuff, things happened and I ate dinner. I thought the frozen chicken wings didn&#x27;t taste good, maybe becuase I have been eating fruits all day. In school, a friend of mine and me were thinking of starting a band. It will be cool, we had idea names like; &quot;The critters, Hyro, The bugs, A minor, etc&quot;. Get it? &quot;A minor&quot;, because we are minors. Anyways, while talking a mentioned a band, my friend knew who the band was, very little people know about them. The band is called &quot;Good Kid&quot;. They make amazing songs, rock-ish, but so so cool. He mentioned a band, I knew the band as well, &quot;RadioHead&quot;. They make good songs too. So then we just discussed possible band names. I will be manager, he will be producer/back up intrumental. I don&#x27;t really play an intrument. It never intrested me, but I found that I was in awe of others playing it. I like the sounds, I like the rythem, just playing it is the problem.</p>
<p>I will brush then sleep.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-23th-">March 23th 🔻<a href="#march-23th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 23th 🔻" title="Direct link to March 23th 🔻">​</a></h3>
<p>I woke up, then went to the mall. We went there, I didn&#x27;t wear jeans so I felt cold. While we were there we bought a stuffed cat that was as tall as I am. Just kidding it was like 4.5 feet something, and 2 feet wide. We also went to many, and I mean many shoe stores to find a shoe for me. I am very picky with it, I want a shoe that has a high top. Like boots or something, so I am picky. My parents say the shoe cant be white, so yeah. I found a nice black shoe, it was PUMA, good quality. It was a size 12, did not fit me, it was tight. Size 12 US does not fit me, I know I know, I have big-ish feet. I wear size 13, so I expected 12 not to fit. In the end we did not find a shoe for me, it is fine, I have boots. I like boots, they fit and are always so comfortable. My brother is happy with the giant cat stuffed toy, he wanted it for a while, it looked so funny when he held it. It is bigger than him, taller too. We then went to a store, we bought bags of candies and some art supplies.</p>
<p>A week ago I signed up to make an art peice for my school&#x27;s auction, it is due in one week. I haven&#x27;t started, so I should deffinetly get to it. What should I do right now? It is saturday, I am not very lazy or tired. I guess I could; either catch up or school-work, or start the art piece, and maybe even relax.</p>
<p>Currently 9:30, I painted for a bit, happy with it. I then relaxed and played video games with my dad, I then ate lunch. Then relaxed, then painted. I spent some time doing random things, I exersiced a bit. I also played with the new cat. I will now sleep. Today was fun, I got things done. Saturday, tomorrow is sunday. Painting took up a long time, because good things take time. I painted the sky and the sun, also part of the ocean, I am making a landscape type painting. It looks nice already, I will make it better though.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-24th-">March 24th 📌<a href="#march-24th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 24th 📌" title="Direct link to March 24th 📌">​</a></h3>
<p>I woke up, wasted time regretfully. Damn it do I regret wasting time? No, why? I should, I just don&#x27;t take it seriously. So I did 50 pushups, my form was alright. I did regular pushups, nothing too crazy, but still, 50. That is a big number for me, I did 5 sets of 10, with a 5 second break between them. Maybe becuase I am rested I can do it better/more in the morning. Will go eat breakfeast.</p>
<p>Currently 10:31, I ate pancakes then painted. I got the sea looking nice in my painting, I will show a photo. Now 11:30, spent some time watching videos of people paint, amazing how simple yet complex things are. You need to be creative to do things, artists are very creative. My art piece is mostly water and sky, so folliage is nonexistant. I also watched some boxing clips of Mike Tyson. I will do something now.</p>
<p>Messed around with my 10lbs weight for a while, did many things with them, including lateral raises, it was cool. I then did some pushups, I did 100 pushups before 12:30. I did some early in the morning, some later in the morning, but I managed to do 100. My goal is to do 200 pushups today, I did 50 just now, they are getting eaiser. Or rather I am getting stronger, nice. So anyways, I ate left over chinese food from yesterday, it tasted phenomenal. Moving on it is 1:45, I will relax for a bit, drink water, maybe even eat an apple. I want big muscles, but getting them takes time, so I should be healthy.</p>
<p>Currently 2:17, now 3:11, did some things. I can do 20 pushups with (sort of) ease, nice. Currently 6:33, did some things, went to play outside with my brother. He does not listen, he always walks off onto the road and is just plain annoying. I&#x27;m not going next time, he just doesn&#x27;t listen. I then did some more things, I painted a bit, looks nicer than before. My mom is helping me alot during the painting procces. Just did 40 pushups, brings my total to a little more than 260 pushups today. I took my time and it payed off. Currently 7:30-ish, I will eat dinner soon. Just kinda relaxing right now.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s funny, I just remembered something. While playing outside with my brother, we saw a giant raccoon, it was huge. It was chubby, and looked like a cat, only thing that let us know it was a racoon was the tail. We couldn&#x27;t see the front of it, but it looked like a cat.</p>
<p><em>Next day, slept.</em></p>

<p>I woke up, night passed by very quick, I am getting good sleep now-a-days, nice. So I did some things, and I am now back. I am just messing around with Scratch for a school project, very cool introductory coding site. Currently 5:13, now 5:41, spent some time figuring out how to find any point at any rotation. Like formula based, not just by eye-balling it. Currently 6:00, I could not figure out how to find any point on the circle, in fact I have no clue. Currently 6:47, I wasted a bunch of time, I deeply regret it, but I feel no regret, I feel nothing. I feel neither sad nor happy, I must stop wasting time, it is messing with me.</p>
<p>Currently 8:51, what did I do? I spent some time with my family till 7:00, then exersiced till 7:41. I then relaxed with my dad then ate dinner. At 7:00, I decided to exersice till all the pieces of lettuce in my bowl are gone, I would eat 1 peice of lettuce for every 10 pushups.</p>
<p><em>Next day, did some things, slept.</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-26th-">March 26th 📘<a href="#march-26th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 26th 📘" title="Direct link to March 26th 📘">​</a></h3>
<p>I haven&#x27;t been writing much here, I should though, currently 6:30. Today is rest day, so I won&#x27;t exersice. I went to school watched a basketball game, then played handball for an hour in gym. Afterwards I played soccer with Hiro and Caleb for another hour. The basketball game was between teachers and students, the teachers won, the students did good though. On the boys team there was (a singular girl) this one girl who was very fast, surpirisingly so, she isn&#x27;t very big either so she slipped through the big adults. There were two teams facing them, the girls and boys teams. They ultimatly lost in the end, but still was good. I just watched, I honestly did not try out for the team, why? Split second dicion and I though, &quot;Nah, no&quot;. So anyways, I will maybe work on some homework and study a bit. Haven&#x27;t studied in a while, why? Been busy exersicing and spending time with my family, but that still is not an excuse. I will study today, surely.</p>
<p>Currently 7:57, I am working on my presentation about Canadian residential schools, it is very dark and disturbing. Search it up, read up on it. I don&#x27;t understand how no one knows about this. They apoligised in 2008, but killed thousands of children. They did things so criminal I can&#x27;t write down. Five to sixteen kids were abused, in many ways, yes I know what your think, yes they were. It was a dark part in canadian history, that only canada, or some canadians know about. Like how does no one know about this? They kidnapped hundreds of thousands of kids and forced them into their religeon. They were killed, slaughtered, and treated like wild beasts. Search it up, and you&#x27;ll be surpirsed.</p>
<p>But anyways, I won&#x27;t study today, I just worked on the presentation.</p>
<p>Now, 8:15, spent some time looking and studying some html stuff. õ, see that? I can do that with html, cool. I will now update the site. Haven&#x27;t done that in a few weeks. Now 8:30, I updated the site.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-27th-">March 27th 🔵<a href="#march-27th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 27th 🔵" title="Direct link to March 27th 🔵">​</a></h3>
<p>I got home late, at around 5:00. I played basketball for about 1 and a half hours after school, so I was late when I got home. My parents were mad, which is reasonable. So now it is 6:30, holy I wasted an hour an a half just now. And I was just wasting time, this is not good. I will do 200 pushups by the end of the day. Lets go, I&#x27;ll do it right now.</p>
<p>Currently 6:46, I did the 100 pushups. I first did 7 sets of 10, then 6 sets of 5. It took me 16 minutes, that&#x27;s about 25 pushups per 4 minutes.  Which is about 1 pushups in 10 seconds?? How does that make any sense? I did 10 pushups rested for 10 seconds, then another 6 sets of ten. Afterwards I did 6 sets of 5, with 10 second breaks too. That&#x27;s like 3 minutes of rest, but lets say I was wrong, maybe 4 or 5. Which still doesn&#x27;t make sense? It took maybe 2 to 3 seconds per pushups, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rest: 4 minutes-ish</li>
<li>Pushups: 4 minutes-ish</li>
</ul>
<p>So how, how does this make sense? Maybe I rested longer than I thought? But still, it would only make sense if I rested for 12 minutes, and that too I&#x27;m rounding up the minutes. But anyways, I will do some school work now, exersicing is good. Currently 7:40, spent a while just listening to music. I am now working on school work, I did like 4 writing prompts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rocket</li>
<li>Sati</li>
<li>Forest</li>
</ul>
<p>If I had a duck I would name it rocket. Currently 8:00, gonna write the story &quot;Voyage 63&quot; for my assignment. Ate dinner, I am at 130 pushups, I need to do them before I sleep. I just now ate food, so it is not s good idea do do pushups. I just ddi 20, anyways. 140, 150, 160, 180, 190, 200. I bet my form was not great, but I feel happy I did 200 pushups.</p>
<p>Currently 9:30, will sleep.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="march-28th-">March 28th 🌎<a href="#march-28th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to March 28th 🌎" title="Direct link to March 28th 🌎">​</a></h3>
<p>I was grounded from yesterday, so I just walked home without wasting time. I just went to costco and got lot&#x27;s of things, I like costco, is has good prices. Hotdogs are 1.50 CAD, amazing. Currently 8:40, I have been just planning what I&#x27;m gonna do for the Voyage 63 book. I think I&#x27;m gonna keep writing it for years to come, and once I graduate collage I will release it.</p>
<p>Currently 10:00, ate dinner, we got from costco. We bought pizza, fries, and poutine. The poutine was a solid 8/10, amazing, not too salty. The poutine was basicly mush, but it was still very tasty, they put so (so) much cheese. The fried were huge, and very filling, the price is also just hard to beat. The quantity was perfect for the price, nice. The pizza was also very nice, good quality, overall great. I am not a food critic but I like food, and this is a blog. Though now-a-days I&#x27;m busy just doing things, and there is not much to write about one single action I&#x27;m doing. That does not reveal anything personal of course.</p>
<p><em>Next day, slept. Forgot to mention but I signed up to be MC for a school concert. It should be fun, right?</em></p>

<p>Damn, two to three months left till school ends. Shoot I&#x27;m a big kid now, cool. Nice, whatever, I was just writing and plannin the voyage 63 story, Been an hour since I started, currently 8:40. This will be legenday, a game company will create my book at a game when I&#x27;m older. I wan&#x27;t to be scientist but writing is also fun, I will just write on the side for fun. Yesterday I was comparing hand sizes with my classmates, my hand is the same size as every guy in my class. Even if they are half my height, they still have the same hand size. Though maybe thats not true, as most of them just pushed their hand higher (cheating). But anyways, they had skinny fingers. My thumb was double the thickness of their thumbs, so were my other fingers. But maybe it&#x27;s because I use my hands a lot. My hands a super boney but that means that my fingers can get thicker and stronger. Like a cup of water, the bigger, the more water you can fill. But I need to pour more than a smaller cup to get to the top, the water being visible is harder to do with a bigger cup. But inreturn is hold more, so each has its consequences.</p>
<p>Currently 9:00 in the morning, I am still working on the story. I exersiced for a while, then ate lunch at 12:30-ish. Currently 1:37, I will continue writing the story till 2:00. Stopped at 2:30, I then relaxed for a bit, then relaxed some more. I then spent some time with my parents, then played games. Afterwards I played more games, I played for hours, I haven&#x27;t done that in  long time.I played a lego racing game, the quality and graphics were out of this world. It was so fun, I mean you can break things and watch them crumble into legos. It is satisfying, anyways I will do something.</p>
<p>Played some games, spent time with my family a bit. I relaxed a lot today, it is friday and I have no school today. I will work more on the story then sleep.</p>
<p>10:15, will sleep now.</p>

<p>I woke up, spent time with my family, then talked to my grandparents. I then spent some more time with my fsmily, afer that I wasted time. Till about 11:20-ish, then did 50 pushups. MY goal today is to do 200. Currently 11:45, yeah my day just started.</p>
<p>Now 12:17, I exersiced a bit with the weights. I punched my 10lbs weight a couple times, is it good for me? Anyways, I will do some school work.</p>
<p>Currently 2:40, spent some time just watching TV. Naruto is getting very intresting, sasuke is really cool. Currently 3:00, did- you know... then I did 50 pushups. I found out how to do pushups more effciently:</p>
<ul>
<li>1st Pushup: Inhale</li>
<li>2nd Pushup: Exhale</li>
</ul>
<p>And just keep repeating this, and one more thing; keep going, do not stop till you reach a number divisible by 5. When you reach a number divisible by 5, stop and breath in and out, then continue. This makes it easier for you to keep your breath and go longer/faster. Of course this is just my personal experiance, maybe studies can show different, but according to my experiances this is how I do more and do them without having to worry about breath.</p>
<p>Anyways, I will continue working on my story. Currently 4:00, worked on it a bit, heading to the airport now.</p>
<p>Currently 7:43, back from the airport. I will do some more pushups, at 100 right now. Currently 8:07, did 100 more. I then washed hands and face. Currently 8:10, I am now at 200 pushups. Lets goooo, my head hurts from the blood rushing. I will relax for a bit, yeah.</p>
<p><em>Next day, slept after eating dinner.</em></p>

<p>Woke up at like 7:30, made breakfeast. Grapes, bannana, apple, bread, butter, milk, chocolate, and salt. It was not bad, I enjoyed it. I will work on the story now, 9:35. Currently 10:10, will go to a park.</p>
<p>Currently 3:00, I came back at like 11:30, then ate lunch. After that I just wasted time unfortunatly. I will do something now, study maybe. Now 3:22, I relize that, to do, is to do what you did not do. So if I want to do, I need to stop not doing things. So to not do, I need to not do what I&#x27;m doing. So I will study, yeah.</p>
<p>Reading about rational and radical equations. 4<sup>1/2</sup> = √4</p>
<p>How:</p>
<ul>
<li>4^1/2 =? 4*0.5</li>
<li>4^1/2 =? 2</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it is the latter, as 4^2 = 4*4. So 4^1/2 should be just 2. 4^1 = 4 so this leads me to think that the latter is seemingly correct.</p>
<ul>
<li>2*2 = 4</li>
<li>2*2^2 = 8</li>
<li>(2*2)^2 = 16</li>
</ul>
<p>The small changes have big impacts, it seems that placement is super important.</p>
<p>2x<sup>2</sup> the coefficent is 2, the base is x, the exponent is 2. So x^2 then 2<em>that. If x is 4 then the answer to that equation would be 32. 4</em>4 = 16 . . . 2(16) = 32. Yeah, it seems coefficents are last.</p>
<ul>
<li>2x^2 + 2x^2 = 4x^2</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently 5:45, I played games with my dad for a while. I had a lot of fun, we played a zombie towerd defence. I could&#x27;ve studied or exersiced bu I played games, cool. I enjoyed it, I don&#x27;t feel like it was a waste of time, I deem it good. Now to exersice, do some pushups variation.</p>
<p>Currently 6:18, I exersiced till 6:10, then looked at myself in the mirror for a while. I styled my hair using water, it was fun. Anyways, I did 100 pushups, my upper chest muscle hurts. I will have a big chest and strong arms after doing this consistently. I will relax for a bit now, I am eating a cookie.</p>
<p>master of ceremonies</p>
<p>Currently 10:22, I ate dinner-ish. I was about to eat chicken wings, but then had a stomach ache. I haven&#x27;t had a stomach ache is a long time, it was strange, but it hurt. My father told me not to eat the chicken wings as my stomach will feel worse because of the grease and oil. I agreed but the tempting look of hot, juicy chicken wings almost broke my will to not eat. I stood stead-fast and watched as my younger brother ate the chicken, occasionally showing to me and saying &quot;look how juicy this it&quot;. Never before have I felt such dismay and agony infront of food such as that, my thought of my stomach was one of great pride and cockiness. I believe there to be nothing my stomach can&#x27;t devour, but alas the tides have shifted and my stomach growled not of hunger, but of defeat. Defeat in the face of juicy chicken, what thou do to get chicken wings in fraught with peril and senseless advocates of pain. But yet, I could not eat.</p>
