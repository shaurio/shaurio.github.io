<p>It is now Febuary, wow. I remember when I started this in January. Im still in Canada, currently 8th grade. If you have not read January, please do. Anyways, back to work.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="febuary-1st-">Febuary 1st 🎉<a href="#febuary-1st-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Febuary 1st 🎉" title="Direct link to Febuary 1st 🎉">​</a></h3>
<p>Today is Feb 1, I will start writing here. Right now is 5:22, Im practicing for my presentation that I started in December 2023. I am going to present it tomorrow. It&#x27;s odd, tomorrow is super important. It may seem like I spent too much time on a simple school project, but I did it on the side. Study, relax, work on presentation, go to sleep. Anyways, I will practice for my presentation tomorrow, wish me luck.</p>
<p>I am confident I will do well, I have prepared and I am 100% ready for tomorrow. Today is thursday by the way. Anyways, I will look to see if I have anything, if I don&#x27;t- I relax. I have no homework, I will fix up &quot;January&quot;. This is gonna take a while. Never mind, decided to excerice.</p>

<p>Hey, went to school. Turns out that not enough people finished the presentation for anyone to be able to present it. Yeah? Anyways, today we presented our &quot;Ads&quot; videos. For the past couple weeks, we have been working on making a video to sell something. My group was with Amirhossien, Enoch, Godswill, Milad, and me. We &quot;sold&quot; playstation merch. It turned out amazing and was incredibly succesful. Though I did not get the chance to present one presentation. At least another project I worked on was presented. In my opinion, ours was the best. Ours was around 3 minutes long while others were 1 minute or less. I know that quantity does not mean quality. But, ours needed to be long to give the watcher info about the &quot;merch&quot; we were &quot;selling&quot;. It was fun. Anyways, now its 9:00. I mostly relaxed today. I regret it, but it was nice. During school these days I always play soccer, I have been for the past 3 years. I also like basketball, but am more into soccer nowaday&#x27;s. I am now gonna sleep. I hope I read this later.</p>
<p>Its funny, yesterday I forgot that we were going to present our &quot;ads&quot;. Cool, it was an assigntment for &quot;Media literacy&quot;. I will present my &quot;Low HDI and High HDI&quot; project next week. Eh.</p>

<p>It is saturday. Currently 1:34. Got back from going to the park near my school Janet. We picked up chinese food from &quot;Peking&quot; and ate it. I also tried the soda Crush for the first time, it was okay, until 5 minutes later my stomach starting burning. The taste of tasty chinese food was gone. Anyways, Im mostly gonna relax this weekend. Currently 4:44, took a shower, relaxed. Now Im gonna study, what do I study? Im gonna study some biology stuff, I do not want to study math now. I will study it afterwards.</p>
<p>Root Epidermal Cell: A hair of a plants root that helps the plant absorb more water</p>
<p>After studying about &quot;Specialized cells&quot; and doing some math. I will excerice. My back hurts cause of laying around previously. Currently 6:30, I exsercized and afterwards my dad showed me his progress on a website he is creating called &quot;Bravoboard&quot;. It is an online card for any occasion. Anyways, gonna relax now. I also got an Email from Dash.</p>

<p>Went to Canadian Tire, its cool. I got back at 12:15. Currently 12:32, something I found was that is you have a number you don&#x27;t know like 765/9 =? you can just think 720/9 = 80 and 45/9 = 5. So 80+5=85 thus 765/9=85! I know its common sense but I just used division on paper, but it is really simple. Anyways, back to work.</p>
<p>Yard to feet: 1:3</p>
<ul>
<li>Three feet is one yard</li>
<li>Nine yards is 27 feet</li>
</ul>
<p>Percentage is: Part/Whole * 100</p>
<ul>
<li>12/60 * 100 = 0.20 * 100 . . . 20%<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>12 * 5 = 60 so 12 = 0.2 * 60</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>55/220 * 100 = 0.25 * 100 . . . 25%<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>55 * 2 = 110 and 110 * 2 = 220 so 55 = 1/4 of 220 or 0.25 * 220</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is 250% of 12?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we know that % = Part/whole * 100. In this equation we know the whole; &quot;12&quot; and the <strong>%</strong>; &quot;250&quot;. All we need to do is find the &quot;Part&quot; of the equation. This is how:</p>
<ul>
<li>250% = Part/12 * 100 . . . 250%/100 = Part/12</li>
<li>Then: 2.5 = Part/12 . . . 2.5*12 = (Part/12) * 12 . . . 30 = Part</li>
</ul>
<p>We found out that the Part is 30. So 250% of 12 is 30. This can be applied most places. You know those questions with lots of items and percentages? Well its Like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You need to buy 65 watermelons, they cost 10$ each, but you got taxed for 40% of the total cost. You buy them and have them shipped to your house. While they were being trasported to your house. Exactly 20% of the watermelons broke on the way. Oh no!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How much did the watermelons + tax cost?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How many watermelons are still alright?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I made this myself, so I need to solve it. Alright, If you finished Im gonna explain it:</p>
<p>We need to buy 65 watermelons, alright. They each cost 10$, so 65 * 10 = 650$. But we got taxed for 40% of the total! So:</p>
<ul>
<li>140% = Part/650 * 100</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the representation of the first question. We found the percentge; 100 + 40. We also found the whole; 650 or (65*10). Now all we need to find is the Part:</p>
<ul>
<li>140%/100 = Part/650 . . . 1.4 = Part/650 . . . 1.4 * 650 = (Part/650) * 650</li>
<li>So 910 = Part</li>
</ul>
<p>We found how much 40% tax is of the total. It is 910$ with tax for 65 watermelons. If we wanted to know what the percentage change between 910 and 650, we could plug these numbers in as Part and whole respectivly then solve from there. Anyways! Now we have to find out how many watermelons are still okay.</p>
<p>We know that 20% of the watermelons are broken, but all we have to find is how many are still alright. How we find that is by either making the &#x27;%&#x27; 20, then substract that from the whole (65). Or we could do it by making the &#x27;%&#x27; 80, that would get the answer instantly. The latter would be harder, I think. I will show 3 ways of doing it:</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Percentage = 20</p>
<ul>
<li>20% = Part/65 * 100 . . . 20%/100 = Part/65 . . . 0.2 = Part/65</li>
<li>So: 13 = Part</li>
</ul>
<p>We found the amount of watermelons that broke, now we need to find how many are alright.</p>
<ul>
<li>Broke + NotBroke = TotalMelons</li>
<li>13 + NotBroke = 65</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we find the ones that are not broken:</p>
<ul>
<li>65 - 13 = 52</li>
</ul>
<p>We found that the ones not broken amount to 52 watermelons.
Onto the next way!</p>
<hr>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Percentage = 80</p>
<ul>
<li>80% = Part/65 * 100 . . . 80%/100 = Part/65 . . . 0.8 = Part/65</li>
<li>So: 52 = Part</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 80% is = to 100% - 20. We know know that the remaining 80% of watermelons amount to 52. Nice.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="3">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>We know that the total is 65 watermelons, 20% of them broke, so 80% is fine. So what is 10% of 65?</p>
<ul>
<li>10% of 65 = 6.5</li>
<li>20% of 65 = 6.5 * 2 . . . 13</li>
<li>40% of 65 = 13 * 2 . . . 26</li>
<li>80% of 65 = 26 * 2 . . . 52</li>
</ul>
<p>So we now know that 80% of 65 watermelons is 52 watermelons. There, easy.</p>
<hr>
<p>Alright was that useful? Anyways, Im gonna take a break. Currently 3:30, ate a PB&amp;J that I made. It was horrendus, if I ate the whole thing I would have fallen il. I put too much peanut butter, I feel not good. Anyways, Im gonna relax for a bit mmore then get back to work. Never mind, it is now 5:00, my parents took a walk to my high school through a trechourous forest trail. Anyways, I relaxed for more than a bit. My parents came back and showed me a video our naigbor in california sent, the video showed how it was super windy and stormy. Our other neighbors trees were almost gonna fall over. Its funny, here in cannada, the weather not only perfect with clear CLEAR blue skies. But it is also nice and warm, maybe because its warm in canada it is stormy in california. It evens out.</p>
<p>Alright, currently 5:52, I spent 50 minutes exsercising. I will relax now, I have a headache. I am also eating an apple, I love eating fruits and vegtables, not cus they are healthy. They taste good thats all, unhealthy food also tastes good. In fact a lot of food tastes good.</p>
<p>Anyways, here is another problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At your school there is an event where each student needs to donate 2 pair of socks each. At the end of the event, only 35% of students donated socks. There are 245 people at your school that donated socks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How many students are there in total?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How many individual socks were donated? (NOTE: 1 pair of socks = 2 socks)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, how do we solve this? I will explain, why not:</p>
<p>We know that 35% of students donated socks, we also know that 35% of the school is 245 people. Now we find out what 100% of the school&#x27;s population is.</p>
<ul>
<li>35% = 245/Whole * 100 . . . 0.35 = 245/Whole . . . 0.35 * Whole = 245</li>
<li>So: Whole = 245/0.35 . . . 700</li>
</ul>
<p>As I was the one who made the question. This is correct. Im in shock how I got this right. Anyways, I will continue working. I used the formula(s):</p>

<p>These were differnt ways to get different things. Anyways, back to work. Thank you KhanAcedemy.</p>
<p>Currently 9:15, I finished dinner. Today, my mother made chicken and pepperoni pizza, and another one with just pepperoni. At dinner we watched a documentary called &quot;Daughter of Destiny&quot;. It was about how a man created a school for the poor. He wanted to make a school to rid poverty of the quote &quot;Untouchable&quot; families. The caste system still exists in small villages. He built the school on the outskirts of Bangalore. This man has my respect. Anyway, I just thought it was a sad/real documentary. It showed the students lives and how they lived. The school educated the students, and hoped they would succeed and bring their families out of poverty.</p>
<p>Anyways, I will study some more? Then sleep. I did not study, I slept.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="febuary-5th-">Febuary 5th 👔<a href="#febuary-5th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Febuary 5th 👔" title="Direct link to Febuary 5th 👔">​</a></h3>
<p>Today is Monday, I did not have a great day. My shirt disappeared, someone could have taken it by mistake. Or stolen it. I dont think someone stole it though, Im a big person. I am almost 6ft and am not skinny or fat, I wouldn&#x27;t mess with me. But that&#x27;s in my opinion, maybe somone did it just to be annoying, or it was accidental. I will show photo&#x27;s of myself in a couple years. Anyways, I will do some studying. Never mind, I watched the minions movie for about an hour. It is currently 5:45. Wow. Back to work.</p>
<p>What I learned just now was about how to get a decimal and fraction out of a percentage.</p>
<p>Solve:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tom now knows that 25% of the adults in his school, are above 5 ft 7 inches. He wonders what that is in decimals, and also what it is in simplest fraction form. He needs this for a school project. His height is 75% of 6ft, is he above 5ft 7 inches?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is 25% in decimals?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is 25% as a simplified fraction?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is Tom&#x27;s height above 5ft 7 inches? And how tall is Tom?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright so 25% just means 25 per cent. Cent is 100, so 25 per 100.</p>
<ul>
<li>25 per 100 . . . 25:100 . . . 25/100</li>
</ul>
<p>Per can be wrote with &quot;:&quot; because it shows a rate or comparison. This can also be writen as 25/100, because a rate of 20 miles per 2 hours can also be writen as &quot;20:2&quot; which just means 20/2 is the answer for the rate of miles per hour the speed is (10 miles/hour). Get it? Moving on:</p>
<ul>
<li>So 25/100 . . 1/4</li>
</ul>
<p>I divided by 25, y&#x27;know. Anyways, we found the simplest fraction. Now we have to find the decimal form and how tall he is.</p>
<ul>
<li>We found that 25% = 25/100</li>
<li>So 25/100 . . . 1/4 . . . 0.25</li>
</ul>
<p>We found the decimal by getting 25 divided by 100. It is that simple. Now we should find his height:</p>
<ul>
<li>We know his height is 75% of 6ft</li>
<li>So; Height = 75% times 6ft . . . 0.75 * 6ft . . . 0.75 * 72 inches . . . 54 inches</li>
<li>Height = 54 inches</li>
</ul>
<p>We found that he is 54 inches tall, now we need to convert it into ft:</p>
<ul>
<li>So 12 inches per 1 ft . . . 12:1 . . . 12/1 . . . 12</li>
<li>We know that he is 54 inches</li>
<li>54 - (12 * <em><strong>4</strong></em>) = <em><strong>6</strong></em> inches remaining</li>
</ul>
<p>I got 4 feet 6 inches, so Tom is not above 5ft 7 inches. Tom is clearly a little kid around 7 or 8, my younger brother is 7. Anyways, now that we solved this. I will continue to study.</p>
<p>Random:</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is 35% of 740?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So 0.35 * 740 = 259. There. According to Khacademy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;what&quot; means X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;is&quot; means =</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;of&quot; means multiplied by *</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;percent&quot; means divided by 100</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>26 is what percent of 100?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So 26 = x/100 * 100. Meaning 26 is 26% of 100. There.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;In what form should I enter my answer? Questions on the SAT may ask for &quot;what percent&quot; and require you to enter that value into the answer field. In these instances, you should not enter decimal or fractional equivalents, but instead enter the percent value as an integer (without a sign). So, if the answer is 50% simply write 50.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Alright thats cool, I will most likely take the SAT in a year. I dunno. Now back to work.</p>
<p>I found something intresting I thought I woulf write for later reference.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You got to a candy shop with 100$, you buy a bag of gummies for 14$, these gummies were on sale at 30% off. You later go home and wonder how much the full price would have been without the disscount. You dont wonder anything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So lets solve:</p>
<ul>
<li>1x - 0.3x = 14 . . . 0.7x = 14 . . . x = 14/0.7 . . . x = 20</li>
</ul>
<p>We found out that the bag of gummies would have costed 20$ without the disscount. Nice. If you dont know what I did, examine the work I showed. That is the best way to learn, by thinking. 100% - 30% = 70%. Anyways back to work.</p>
<p>Another problem I made about percentage change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You got to the local supermarket and buy grapes, they cost 12$ for a box. They used to cost 6$. You are unhappy and wonder by how much percent did the price go up. You see a duck waddling away with 36 boxes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By how much did the percentage increase? (12 -&gt; 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How much did 24% of the grapes the duck was holding cost?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So:</p>
<p>We know that % = difference/initial * 100, yeah.</p>
<ul>
<li>% = 12-6/6 * 100 . . . 6/6 * 100 . . . 1 * 100</li>
<li>So a 100% increase in price</li>
</ul>
<p>It does not take a genius to find this, but I got 100% for the increase. All other numbers just ended in a &quot;0.33~~~&quot;. Also 25% of 36 is the same as 1/4 of 36 which is 9. Anyways, back to work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A toy lambo costs 40$ but is on sale for 30% off. Today is a special day, at the check out they will get an additional disscount. After billing the final cost is 22.40$.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is 30% off of 40$?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What was the additional disscount? (EX: 12%, 44%, etc)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So 30% of 40$ is 28$, how I know? 20%</p>
<ul>
<li>40/10 = 4</li>
<li>4 * 7 = 28</li>
</ul>
<p>I found 10% of 40, then found 70%. Now how do we find the extra disscount?</p>
<ul>
<li>28 - 22.40 = 5.6</li>
<li>5.6/28 = 0.2</li>
<li>0.2 * 100 = 20</li>
</ul>
<p>I found that the extra disscount is 20%. As always we know that % = difference/initial * 100. By the way, this was totally not copied from KhanAcedemy, wink wink. Back to work. I finished the &quot;percentages&quot; part of S.A.T Khanacedemy section. Nice, it is currently 7:32. I will take a break. Sleep.</p>

<p>Today, I went to school. I honestly doubt I will get a chance to present my presentation. After all, I am the only doing it. No one else wants to present. Maybe sometime later? Anyways, It is currently 5:17, I will finish up some homework and other tasks. I did some work, it is currently 7:07. I am eating KFC, I love KFC. True, it is pricy, but once a while it is incredibly yum.
Now it is 8:30. I will head to bed. Why am I writing these things? Well it&#x27;s to see what I myself did today. At school, I measured my height, I was 69 inches. Thats like 5 feet 9 inches. Dang it, I really thought I was taller. Anyways, off to sleep.</p>

<p>Today, I presented my presentation. It went pretty well, I asked &quot;Amirhossien&quot; to help me click next on my slides. He did not do a stellar job. But it went well nonetheless. Im going to get back to work. Currently 4:30, gonna relax for 30 minutes. I relaxed, it is now 5:17, I finished exsercising and am eating the remaining KFC. Currently 6:30, I just wasted time. I really should study now. I have done my french homwork. Now I will study, currently 7:00. Just started a &quot;Statistics&quot; unit in KhanAcedemy, I am not super stoked.</p>
<ul>
<li>Average = The middle/center/most-typical</li>
</ul>
<p>The average joe, the average person. The most typical person, the center level of all/if not most humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Arithmetical mean: The sum of all numbers divided by the # of numbers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So 1,2,3,4,5 . . . How 2 find the mean?</p>
<ul>
<li>(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) / # of numbers</li>
<li>15 / 5 . . . 3</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, back to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Median: The middle number/the number in the center (Least to greatest format or reverse only)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So 1,2,3,4,5 . . . How 2 find the median?</p>
<ul>
<li>1 2 <strong>3</strong> 4 5 What is the center number? It is 3</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now 1,2,3,4,5,6 . . . How 2 get the median?</p>
<ul>
<li>1 2 <strong>3 4</strong> 5 6 There are two center numbers, 3 and 4, so 3+4/2 = 3.5 . . . We found the center</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mode: The most common number in a data set</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So 1,2,3,4,1,4,4,5,2,2,2,3 . . . What is the mode?</p>
<ul>
<li>Two 1&#x27;s, Four 2&#x27;s, Two 3&#x27;s, Three 4&#x27;s, and One 5 . . . 2 is the mode/most common</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is Thursday, I had a good day. I feel like I am popular at school, I transfered to my new school 2-3 months ago. I feel like a part of the school now. Anyways, I will relax. Then study, currently 4:36. Now 4:50, gonna study. Did not study, what did I do? I emailed a freind of mine, but there is no way that took one hour. I think I was just doing random things? No, writing the email took an hour. Wow. Anyways, now I will study. Right?</p>
<p>Currently 5:50. Something to note. &quot;Variance is not covered on the SAT, and while you may be asked about standard deviation, you will not need to calculate it on your own&quot;. Alright, anyways.</p>
<p>The range formula:</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Range = Max - Min</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>So if someone were to ask you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the <strong>range</strong> is this data set: 20, 30, 40, 10, 30</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Find range</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so according to the formula. Range = 40 - 10 . . . 30. Is that correct? Yes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the <strong>range</strong> is this data set: -20, -30, -40, -10, -30</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Find range</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, Range = -10 - (-40) . . . 30. You see -10 is the highest number, -40 is the lowest.</p>
<p>Back to work I guess.</p>
<p>This is what I believe the formula to be (For POPulation and SAMple):</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Variance POP = ((Each value in set - Set Mean) each individual value^2 )/# of values</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Variance SAM = ((Each value in set - Set Mean) each individual value^2 )/(# of values - 1)</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Just found out about &quot;variance&quot;, never heard about that before. Its where you take each number, then substract the mean from it. After that you square each of them. Once you have all the squared numbers, average them. Like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the Variance of: 10, 30, 20, 10, 20, 30</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Find Variance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So variance is how much the data set points usually differ from the mean. Somewhat like, the variance in the data set. The standerd deviation in the data set. The most common deviation. The most common value of change. Something like that. In a data set where most values are close to the mean, the variance or standard (typical) deviation (Change/divergence) would be lower than one with values in the set that are farther apart from each other. It does not really have to do with the range.</p>
<p>Like 1 to 4 is 1/4, and 100 to 400 is also 1/4. But in range, 1 to 4 is 3, and 100 to 400 is 300. So range is not to be relied upon. This is what I understood, I could be wrong. This is just to see how varried the points/values are from the mean/each other. It is the variance (differences/discrepancies) of the set. This makes sense, maybe someone would want to use this to know how spread out the values are.</p>
<p>According to KhanAcedemy: &quot;Standard deviation measures the typical spread from the mean; it is the average distance between the mean and a value in the data set.&quot;</p>
<p>Anyways, now to solve it:</p>
<p>We first need the mean,</p>
<ul>
<li>(10+30+20+10+20+30) / 6 . . . 120/6 . . . 20</li>
</ul>
<p>The mean is 20. Now we find the variance:</p>
<ul>
<li>((10 - 20)^2 + (30 - 20)^2 + (20 - 20)^2 + (10 - 20)^2 + (20 - 20)^2 + (30 - 20)^2)/6</li>
<li>((-10)^2 + (10)^2 + (0)^2 + (-10)^2 + (0)^2 + (10)^2)/6</li>
<li>(100 + 100 + 0 + 100 + 0 + 100)/6</li>
<li>(200 + 200)/6 . . . 400/6 . . . 66.66~</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, so we found the variance to be 66.666~ repeating. Is this correct? I&#x27;m not sure. I hope I am. It was correct!!! Lets go. By the way, we are calculating for the population. So if we were calculating for a sample it would be 80. A sample is where you do all the steps you would in &quot;population&quot; but when its time to average the squared values, minus one off of your divisor (Your divisor is the # of values in the set). This makes perfect sense right? There is not much use for this though.</p>
<p>I will continue to study, this was just for fun, none of that was very important. How I checked my work just now was by going to Calculator soups &quot;Variance Calculator&quot;. It works. I just went back and fixed some grammer, currently 7:00. I was not productive, I should have studied other topics. Anyways, I will take a break. Slept.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="febuary-9th-">Febuary 9th 📓<a href="#febuary-9th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Febuary 9th 📓" title="Direct link to Febuary 9th 📓">​</a></h3>
<p>Currently 4:40. I just got back from school. Today was a &quot;Spirit Day&quot; where we were supposed to dress up in fashion from another decade. Barely any people did it. I wore a biker jacket, I looked very cool. If you&#x27;re embarresed, don&#x27;t be. If you do something others dont, like going up and proforming. They can laugh, but they didn&#x27;t have the courage to do that. Being cool, it&#x27;s about being powerful and capable. Being powerful doesnt mean strong, though it can be. Being powerful is when somone views you to be somone dependable and nice. Being cool is not the amount of drugs you take, it&#x27;s the amount of trust people have in you. Who is cooler, a person no one trusts. Or a person who everyone trusts and likes? I will leave that up to you.</p>
<p>Another thing I have to say is, would you rather be the knight, or the king? I would be the king, I can help more people that way. I trust myself, if you don&#x27;t, no one will. I know this may seem random, but today I saw a kid who was getting pushed around and told to confess to his crush. I felt bad and pushed everyone aside (I am powerful) and told this kid that the ones pushing him around aren&#x27;t his friends and that he should just walk away. He did not listen and kept getting <strong>literally</strong> thrown around. I think he wanted/liked the attention. A teacher told me, &quot;Oh well you tried&quot;. I dont know what to do, there are many things that happen that shoulden&#x27;t. If you see somone getting messed with/bullied and you are strong, help them depending on the situation. If a school shooter walks down the hall, run away dont stop. If somone innocent is getting picked on, dont let them be. This may sound goody-two shoes, but the people that say that are the ones who are wrong. How are they wrong? They lack morals, morals define us. If I say I want to be a good person, I will be. If I know what I&#x27;m doing is wrong, do I continue? Most likely no. There are grey spots in everything.</p>
<p>If you are in 6th, 7th, or 8th and you want to be better, make friends. By talking to people, you will learn many things. You might learn about culture, or opportunities you hadn&#x27;t known before. There is nothing wrong with making friends. Of course who you become friends with does not matter, make friends with a bad person? Good, just dont hang around them or learn from them. Connections make the world go &#x27;round. I am just ranting here but trust me, trust yourself. I used to be a theripist/counsler, I learned a lot from the job. I got paid in community service hours. Anyways, be the type of person who is dependable, intresting, and &quot;Cool&quot;. Dependable means you can be counted on, this is very important for many reasons. Being intresting just means you are not a boring person, you get involved in things and go outside your comfort zone. Being cool, as I mentioned previuosly can mean different things for different people, but what it means to me is that you are someone people <strong>want/can/would/could</strong> talk to. No one talks to you? Talk to them, they will talk back. Give and take, take and give. Like I said earlier, be friends with anyone, but hang out with good people. Your 5 closet friends reflect you? No, the type of person you are reflects you. The 5 closet friends you have is just a way to see what kind of people you hang with, that does not mean they are you/you are them.</p>
<p>Anyways, I will do some homework. If any of what I said was cool, good. This stuff works, sometimes people tell me that they thought I was &quot;Royalty&quot; or something because of how &quot;Proper and polite&quot; I am. This makes me feel like I am improving as a person. Be so undeniably strong (powerful), no one doubts you. I like being a leader, sometimes I feel like &quot;I could do it better&quot; and I really could. So when a group project comes up, I will be efficient and effective. Time is money? No time is worth much more. We have finite time, but there is infinite money in the world. I am glad I am 13, I feel like I have time. But in reality I do not. I will be taking S.A.T&#x27;s this or the next year. This will determine a lot, so will the tests in highschool. &quot;I have plenty of time to kill&quot; no you do not. &quot;I can play games hours a day&quot; no you cant. &quot;I have all the time in the world&quot; no no no. When I regret the time I spent, it feels bad. I do not want to regret it, is this a waste of time? No, it further solidifies my percpective of myself. I know I am a good person, I wrote it down is all. I should study now.</p>
<p>Currently 5:30, wow. Now 7:30, I spent some time doing a school project. I mainly just colored. Slept.</p>

<p>Well today is a Saturday. It used to be Feb 1, now it is Feb 10th already. Ten days in an instant, scary. Anyways, I will do some work. Then maybe go out with my family to a park. Currently 11:00, I finsished an assignment about steelpan and taiko drums. We needed to research about the similarities and differences between them. It was not too hard. Anyways, I will study. Anyone know what &quot;Termed&quot; mean? I created a new word called &quot;Termed&quot;! It means; comparatively similar terminologistics in sound and meaning in comparison to the term following. Off topic.</p>

<p>This is all what I understand, you can check these out for yourself if you want.</p>
<hr>
<p>μ &quot;mu&quot; = POPulation mean (The mean of an entire list/values)</p>
<p>Σ &quot;sɪɡmə&quot; = Summation (The sum of the following numbers/values in a list/population or whole of; the preceding/prior)</p>
<p>Xi = The values (x) in the list/population (this can also be termed with &quot;For i in&quot; via coding)</p>
<p>X = An individual value/case in the list/population</p>
<p>N = # of individual value&#x27;s/case&#x27;s in the list/population</p>
<hr>
<p>Moving on... Standard Of Deviation . . . SOD . . . Get it? Anyways.</p>
<p>Standard deviation, what is it? It is similar to &quot;Variance&quot; but much easier to follow. Such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have two lists;</p>
<ul>
<li>One: 10, 20, 10, 20, 10, 20</li>
<li>Two: 30, 20, 00, 20, 10, 40</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Solve for the standard of deviation for both (POPulation wise)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which one has the more spread out values? (List 1 or 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember to round to the nearest <strong>thousandth</strong>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How are we supposed to solve for standard deviation? We find the mean, then subsract every value individualy from the mean. After that we root each value, then divide by the # of values (or -1). Next, we have to root it. After that, we could compare each standardly deviated list to see which one has the more spread out values. It is simpler than it sounds. I watched a couple videos and it looks fancy, it really is not.</p>
<p>If I&#x27;m being honest, standard deviation is meant to see how spread apart numbers are. It is very VERY similar to &quot;variance&quot;. Want to see how different/spread out the values are? Use standard deviation. Need to find an outlier in a list? Use a part of standard deviation, get the mean then substract it from xi. After that see which one is different from the rest. Standard deviation is something you should understand, it will make a lot of sense when you do.</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard deviation = root (Σ(Xi - μ)^2) / N</li>
</ul>
<p>So for list one the <strong>mean</strong> would be; (10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20) / 6</p>
<ul>
<li>(10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20) / 6 . . . 90 / 6 . . . 15</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>mean</strong> for list one is 15, now to find the <strong>standard of deviation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>10 - 15, 20 - 15, 10 - 15, 20 - 15, 10 - 15, 20 - 15</p>
<ul>
<li>Xi - μ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>-5, 5, -5, 5, -5, 5</p>
<ul>
<li>(Xi - μ)^2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25</p>
<ul>
<li>Σ(Xi - μ)^2 = 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>150</p>
<ul>
<li>(Σ(Xi - μ)^2) / N = 150 / 6 . . . 25</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>25</p>
<ul>
<li>root (Σ(Xi - μ)^2) / N = √25 . . . 5</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>5</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard deviation = root (Σ(Xi - μ)^2) / N</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I first found out what &quot;xi - μ&quot; was, then I squared it. After that I divided the Σ of &quot;(xi - μ)^2 by &quot;N&quot;. After all that, I rooted it to find the standard of deviation.</p>
<p>The standard deviation is 5, is this correct? Yes, I checked by using calculator.net.</p>
<p>Now we need to find the mean and standard deviation of the the second list:</p>
<ul>
<li>(30 + 20 + 0 + 20 + 10 + 40) / 6 . . . 120 / 6 . . . 20</li>
</ul>
<p>The mean for the second list is 20, now all thats left is to find the standard deviation. Went to the park and its currently 3:00. Now 3:30, anyways. I just did 192 inclined pushups (my form is questionable), in my opinion, they are easier than normal pushups. I can do about 11 regular pushups at max. Currently 4:42, I will continue to solve this, after eating! Ate some food, back to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The mean is 20 so we substract it from Xi (each value)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>30 - 20, 20 - 20, 00 - 20, 20 - 20, 10 - 20, 40 - 20</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10, 0, -20, 0, -10, 20</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have to square it:</p>
<ul>
<li>100, 0, 400, 0, 100, 400</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we Σ:</p>
<ul>
<li>100 + 0 + 400 + 0 + 100 + 400 . . . 1000</li>
</ul>
<p>I fully did not expect it to add up to 1000, the numbers I chose were purely random. Now we divide by N:</p>
<ul>
<li>1000 / 6 . . . 166.6666666667 . . . Also = 166 2/3</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have to root 166 2/3. I dont wanna- never mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>√166.6666666667 = 12.909944487359</li>
</ul>
<p>We found out the the SOD (Standard Of Deviation) of set/list two was 12.910 (Thousandth wise) rounded. Nice, now we have to have to answer question two. But first:</p>
<ul>
<li>List one SOD: 5</li>
<li>List two SOD: 12.910</li>
</ul>
<p>So which one has the values most spread out? Most likely the one with the higher SOD value. So we can safely say that list two is more spread out. You can say list one or two, but you should show your reasoning and evidence. Anyways, I will relax a bit. Currently 5:30. I was gonna go relax but I should clean my room and excericise. Why? Because I dont like feeling bad about wasting time, plus. I can write down that I did that here, so later, I can see that I was productive today. Regret is something I don&#x27;t like, the feeling of not being able to change the past. Instead, change the present to change the future. Thus changing your futures past. I should get into poetry. Anyways, off to doing stuff.</p>
<p>I cleaned-ish my room, though it still looks messy. Fixed it. I played with my younger brother a little bit (1 hour) then talked with my parents for another hour. At that point it was like 7:30, so I mainly relaxed for the remaining time. I also told myself that everytime I go up/down the stairs, I will do 16 inclined pushups. If I dont do it, I add another 16 for next time. This is a method to ensure I get some exersice while staying home. At school I run around a lot and play soccer with my friends. Anyways, it is now currently 9:15, I will go to bed. And sleep.</p>
<p>By the way, I just checked to see if what I got for list two was correct. It was. <!-- -->:D</p>
<p>My understanding of these concepts grow when I write them down, cool. I now sleeped me tired.</p>

<p>Today I have decided to research a little bit on genetics/genes. Why? Because it facinates me. What are we? How did we come to be? Existence, life, void, consience.</p>
<p>What is existence? I believe existence to be the act of existing, what exists? Us, the world, our sun, and more. If we exist, then do others like us also exist? Probably, unless before we came to be, there was a universal war. What if we are living in the past? Could 100000 years later we discover time travel and wipe out all the aliens before they attack earth? Some random theories I thought of. Everyone knows that space is void, it also has no friction. What isnt there, cannot effect those that are there? I&#x27;ll bet the big bang was just a blackhole that ate the entire universe and became so infinitly unbalenced. If a blackhole the size/mass of the entire universe existed, it would be infinitly large and small? Anyways, we are most likely aliens, could we be a test product of some other advanded civilization to test if life can exist on other planets? Or maybe there was a universal extinction and some &quot;alien&quot; shot out into space some of their species to continue their &quot;Race&quot;. We would not know if something like thanos ever happend. Was anyone who was alive during the dinosuar era alive now? No? If we ever did meet aliens, would they look like us? You need high intelligence to survive and converse, so would they be like us? By the sense of mainly smart not strong. Is a bear smarter than a human? Is a human stronger than a bear? Anyways.</p>
<p>Life, what is it? Why do we even consider ourselves to be &quot;alive? We are all atoms and molecules, so how are we able to move. To think? Is a single celled organism considerd alive? It cannot think or change it&#x27;s code/behaviour. Something I really want to do, is be able to code myself, maybe give myself 2 more arms for the fun of it. That seems incredible, being able to alter your code, maybe using A.I we can &quot;create&quot; a living code to be able to repair oursleves. You know that game called &quot;Scorn&quot;, that is what I strive, life and tech. To be able to create life, make a new speciacs, clone, send them to mars to make it habitible. These are goals I hope to make possible, but I alone am just a person... who dreams big. Robot apocalypse? No, a world war is more likely to happen. Though I pray it does not happen again. These goals I listed may sound impossible, but I would like to see a robot, with a brain when I am older. This is why bio-tech intrests me.</p>
<p>What is void? Void is the existence of null, but if null exists, it isnt void but &quot;null&quot;. Ignore that, anyways. The void of space is cold? No and yes, it is the absence of heat. But the sun gives off heat, so why is it not warm in space? Maybe the absense of heat is so infinite that there is nothing to pass heat onto except things such as planets and life. Something I&#x27;ve thought about is, can we create a sun? Theoretically the sun is just &quot;...a massive, hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated by energy produced by nuclear fusion reactions at its core&quot; according to wikipedia. Can we not make our own hot ball of plasma? Moving on, space is black? No, does space have no color? What are colors, how do they define objects? Is color an objects properties? No, color is an attribute? I&#x27;m sure there are many answers, but thats off topic. Moving on.</p>
<p>What is conscience? The act of thinking, or state of being thoughtful? I don&#x27;t know, but I believe that our consience is all (?) the cells in our body working together to create a &quot;Hive&quot; mind. Whats a hive mind? It is where a &quot;Hive&quot; thinks in unison. We could be an combination of all the &quot;thoughts/actions/being&quot; of the cells in our body. How do we grow? How does our body &quot;know&quot; to do certain things. Are we the ones who &quot;control&quot; the body, or do we effect it. Are we our body or are just &quot;controlling&quot; it? I feel like the most plausible one is that the/our cells coalesced (combined into/to form) our &quot;thought/thinking&quot; proccesses. This may sound absured but when we &quot;think&quot; in our minds/head you know how you can &quot;hear&quot; a voice talking, it&#x27;s assumed to be your voice. But what if that voice is just a memory of you talking that is being replayed in your mind? I think it is so.</p>
<p>Anyways, these were random thoughts. It is currently 12:10, I will do something. You know, being able to create flesh could save lives, it could give an arm back to a man who lost theirs. Maybe we can copy the code of someones arm and &quot;paste&quot;/insert it into someone who lost theirs, how amazing would that be? Maybe someone has a high tolorence to a disiece, if we can transfer that same defences to someone who is more vonurable. How incredible would that be?</p>
<p>Currently 1.00, ate lunch. My mom made pizza, making home-made pizza is really tasty. Anyways, I will look at some bio-tech stuff. I have decided to 100% finish highschool biology in Khanacedemy, just for fun.</p>
<p>Just figured out how to do this!!! --&gt;</p>

There are many different places that say different things, such as &quot;Byjus&quot; saying that &quot;Genes are the DNA stretches which encode for specific proteins&quot; and &quot;Gene is a specific sequence present on a short stretch of DNA&quot;. So genes are made up of DNA or RNA, they are also located on chromosomes. Nucleotides are the colorful line in the DNA double helix. To summarize, genes have DNA stored inside, and are also part of a DNA molecule. And to be honest, I dont fully understand it either. The wording is very odd on every website. I will learn eventually though.</p><p><em>Screenshot of something I made in google slides (I left out some steps at the end)</em>

<p>Currently 8:44, my dad showed me something interesting. Bio-informatics, they are people who research genes and DNA. To be one you need high-level knowledge in biology, math, and compter sciences. It&#x27;s the job I&#x27;ve always wanted to do but never knew existed, I will cure cancer! I know I will, why? By the time I&#x27;m older CRISPR will be a renowned thing and I will be working on it. My idea is pretty cool, but I wrote it down elsewere. CRISPR is something I have always thought should exist, but now that I know it exists. I have to be a part of it and further research (And my own curriousity).</p>

<p>Today I got back from school. We had this fitness test called &quot;The Beep Test&quot;. It is where you run back and forth until you can&#x27;t. We did something similar in California, its where you do 120 laps back and forth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Canada &quot;Beep Test&quot;: Unlimited, 2 cosecutive times missed, 3 times a year</li>
<li>California &quot;Pacer Test&quot;: 80 to 120, 2 non-consecutive times, every wednesday</li>
</ul>
<p>In Canada the &quot;Beep Test&quot; is as far as you can go, if you miss the line 2 times <strong>consecutively</strong> you&#x27;re out. And in California the &quot;Pacer Test&quot; is trying to get 80 to 120 laps, if you miss the line 2 times at all you&#x27;re out. So it was much harder in California, so why did I do so badly here (54 laps)? I have not done it in a while? Im out of shape? Nah, I just need to work on my stamina.</p>
<p>I felt not so great about that, so I did 16 sets of 16 inclined pushups. This may sound like a lot, but if you do 5-5-6 it is much easier. Do five, breath, another five, breathe, then six, breath. Repeat. So 256, strangely I feel better after doing that. It is currently 4:44 and I just wrote this. I&#x27;m gonna relax for a bit now. Currently 5:30, I relaxed for an hour and ate a sandwich. Anyways I will now study some biology.</p>

<p>&quot;A cell in the kidney is specialized to aid in water reabsorption...&quot;</p>
</blockquote><p>This means that the kidney cells main job/spezialization is to reabsorb water from blood and other substances to reuse the water. This is what it was mainly specialized for, though not every single kidney cell has the same job. The kidney eliminates foreign and waste compounds, supervises blood pressure, and produces hormones. It cleans up the liquid and waste in the body.</p><p>According to NCBI &quot;Balzer MS, Rohacs T, Susztak K. How Many Cell Types Are in the Kidney and What Do They Do? Annu Rev Physiol. 2022 Feb 10&quot;:</p><blockquote>
<p>&quot;There are at least 16 different highly specialized epithelial cells in kidneys...&quot;</p>
</blockquote><p>This just means that there are at least 16 types of cells that cover the ins-and-outs of the kidney that each have a job spesific to them. Usually cells were categorized/defined by how they looked or acted. <highlight> The cells in kidneys are usually: tubule epithelial cell, macula densa cell, glomerular endothelial cell, podocyte, mesangial cell and parietal epithelial cell.</highlight> These just make up different parts of the cell. Such as the tubule epithelial cell which is a cell in a tube like area, and the Parietal Epithelial Cell which serves as the parent/maker of podocytes (filters) that don&#x27;t grow/change. These are some cells in the kidney. This is what I understood at least.</p></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary><p>How can cells become specialized?</p></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>How do cells become specialized to carry out certain functions? Cell specialization does not require changing genetic sequences and/or having different genetic makup. It is because of (subset of genes in chromosome (in genome, that are tiny) changes over time to the job it does, that makes it switch jobs (protiens). It does this by expressing genes (the process by which the information encoded in a gene is turned into a function) to change/bring out it&#x27;s job. It&#x27;s like code, how do you change code? You replace it, or run a different code. The same for this, but code is RNA and DNA (Information). This is what I understood. To understand this more, look at the &quot;DNA is information&quot; button.</p></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary><p>DNA is information</p></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>According to Study.com:</p><blockquote>
<p>&quot;DNA is first translated, or copied, into a molecule of messenger RNA. This messenger RNA is then translated into an amino acid sequence or protein that has physical and/or biochemical effects on the body leading to a trait. For example, one protein may result in blue eyes, while another results in brown eyes.&quot;</p>
</blockquote><p>This just means DNA is converted into readable RNA script, or copied. Then it goes to a molecule of an RNA messenger. Afterwards, this RNA messenger is then decoded (converted) into an amino acid sequence or protein that affects a trait (Like eye color, skin color, etc).</p><p>How does this procces happen?</p><p>In initiation, the ribosome assembles (goes to) around the mRNA (messenger RNA) to be read. This signals the DNA to unwind so the enzyme can read the nucleotides/bases/colorful thingies in one of the DNA strands. After that, the mRNA (holding the info) gets read one codon at a time. The codons (sets of 3 nucleotides) get matched up with the amino acid matching each codon. Then it is added to a growing protein chain. Like legos, you find a lego, then add it to your build, you first decide what lego you want to put, and what you want to build. Yeah, so here is an illustration done by me. It is not a perfectly sound illustration, but it serves to give a rough picture of what is going on.</p><p><em>Screenshot of something I made in/using google slides</em>

<p>Slept. Next day.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="febuary-13th-">Febuary 13th 📷<a href="#febuary-13th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Febuary 13th 📷" title="Direct link to Febuary 13th 📷">​</a></h3>
<p>Today, I went to school. At school we took our &quot;Grad Photo&#x27;s&quot;, the photo&#x27;s that will be in year books. I wore a nice white tee. Some people went all out with blazers and suits. It was cool. Anyways, after school ended. I saw some 7th graders pick up dog poop, it did not bother me. They kept throwing it around, alright. Then they threw it at a wall, twice. It left big stains, you can imagine how gross it was. It occured to me that, &quot;Should I stop them&quot;? I did not think they would throw it at the wall, right? If I had intervend the wall would&#x27;ve been clean. But I did not, should I have. Probably.</p>
<p>I relaxed for a while, it is currently 5:30. What was I doing? Just relaxing. Im gonna study some math now. Haven&#x27;t been doing that too often.</p>
<p>I spent so long figuring out how to solve MEDIAN GIVEN FREQUENCY DATA and MISSING VALUES IN DATA SETS. I don&#x27;t understand them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have a set of values, the mean is 10
20, 30, 10, 10, 20, 30, x</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Find x in the set</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sooo:</p>
<ul>
<li>20 +  30 +  10 +  10 +  20 +  30 =  120</li>
</ul>
<p>We know that Total Sum = Mean * Number of Values</p>
<ul>
<li>10 *  7 =  70</li>
</ul>
<p>So x = Total Sum - Sum</p>
<ul>
<li>70 - 120 = -50</li>
</ul>
<p>So x is -50? Is this correct? Yep. I don&#x27;t understand how this is correct. The formula makes zero sense to me, I will try though. It is currently 7:40, I spent an hour an a half with my dad at 5:30 to 7:00-ish. I wrote this at 7:40. Now (7:40) I am trying to figure out how to get the missing value in a data set.</p>
<p>So (120+x)/7 = 10</p>
<p>Ahhhhh, I get it. I... damn.</p>
<p>It is Sum of known numbers + x / # of values = Mean (or in this case 10)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>120 + x / 7 = 10</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>120 + x = 70</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>x = 70 - 120 . . . -50</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>x = -50</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am surprised. :\</p>

<p>Now it makes sense, I am not very happy I didn&#x27;t understand it. Currenlty 8:00. Sigh. I did not do very much today, but I found this great reasource with my dad called &quot;Collage board&quot;. It seems very very helpful. I am not doing much A.I stuff these days, eh I mean studies and stuff comes first. I could do it in my free time, but yeah I should. Tomorrow I will try doing some A.I learning. Anyways, I will most likely eat dinner now.</p>

<p>It is Valentines day! Our school didn&#x27;t have any events planned for today. Someone asked me to be their valentine, I did not say yes or no to her. I should have said yes, I just asked what her name was. She seemed nice, I later learned her name was Temari. She was pretty, I should apologise tomorrow for not giving an answer. Telling/implying to someone &quot;Who are you?&quot; is kinda very mean. I just said it cause I dont know her name. I should say something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I apologise that I didn&#x27;t give you an answer yesterday, I panicked and said something random&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#x27;t know, but anyways. Did you have a velentine? Cause (unfortunately) I do not. So, I will excersice or something. It is not to forget, but it is good for my health. I will try to do 16 sets of 18 inclined pushups, I know I can do it. I just haven&#x27;t done it before. Currently 4:30, maybe I&#x27;ll be back by 5:00. Did 2 sets right now, I&#x27;ll first go get (chinese food) dinner and come back home and do them. Came back. 5:00, did like 8 sets right now. I will eat then do some more? Right now I will relax. Currently 5:45, I will do 8 more sets. Why am I breaking up the sets? I don&#x27;t know, I never do this. I just got busy in between sets. Does doing that diminish the muscle gain? I don&#x27;t know. Off to do 8 sets. 6:00-ish I am done. I will relax. Then study.</p>
<p>Alright, Im gonna study now.</p>
<p>MEDIAN GIVEN FREQUENCY DATA? How do you get it? (n + 1) / 2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So imagine you have a list that is number of pushups per day</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The frequency is:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>05, 02, 04, 01, 04, 02, 00, 01, 02</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Solve for MEDIAN FREQUENCY in pushups (Ex: 10, 13, 18)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how we solve these types of questions is by finding the median frequency. Then finding the numbers/values related to the frequency, in this case it is pushups. So:</p>
<p>Skip to the bottom if you don&#x27;t have the patience to see how not to find the answer. I don&#x27;t reccomend it though.</p>
<hr>
<p>NOT THIS: Mean only</p>
<ul>
<li>(5 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 2) / 9</li>
<li>This is the wrong way</li>
</ul>
<p>NOT THIS: Median only</p>
<ul>
<li>5, 2, 4, 1, 4, 2, 0, 1, 2</li>
<li>2, 4, 1, 4, 2, 0, 1,</li>
<li>4, 1, 4, 2, 0,</li>
<li>1, 4, 2,</li>
<li>4</li>
<li>This is the wrong way</li>
</ul>
<p>NOT THIS: Sorted Median only</p>
<ul>
<li>5, 2, 4, 1, 4, 2, 0, 1, 2</li>
<li>SORT LEAST TO GREATEST (or vice versa)</li>
<li>0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5,</li>
<li>1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4,</li>
<li>1, 2, 2, 2, 4,</li>
<li>2, 2, 2,</li>
<li>2</li>
<li>This is not correct</li>
</ul>
<p>NOT THIS EITHER:</p>
<ul>
<li>(5 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 2) + 1</li>
<li>21 + 1 . . . 22</li>
<li>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22</li>
<li>2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,</li>
<li>3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,</li>
<li>4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,</li>
<li>5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,</li>
<li>6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,</li>
<li>7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,</li>
<li>8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,</li>
<li>9,10,11,12,13,14,</li>
<li>10,11,12,13,</li>
<li>11,12,</li>
<li>The median is between 11th and 12th place</li>
<li>So now we know the between the 11th and 12th is the answer.</li>
<li>Lets find out:</li>
<li>10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18</li>
<li>05, 02, 04, 01, 04, 02, 00, 01, 02</li>
<li>So now we have to get the 11th and 12th place.</li>
<li>5 + 2 = 7</li>
<li>7 + 4 = 11</li>
<li>11 + 1 = 12th</li>
</ul>
<p>Wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;So 11th corresponds to the third value and 12th correspods to the fourth value in pushups. It is 12, because 11th and 12th are in &quot;12&#x27;s&quot; jurisdiction. I used every calculator, it all says 12 in the median. But why!? I don&#x27;t get it. I can&#x27;t seem to find any website that actually explaines it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>THIS IS CORRECT:</p>
<p>So after failing 4+ times on how to get the MEDIAN FREQUENCY. Currently 8:00, I failed so many times.</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">MEDIAN FREQUENCY place/&#x27;th (even) = N/2</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">MEDIAN FREQUENCY place/&#x27;th (odd) = (N + 1) /2</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Since in our problem the ∑/sum of our frequency xi/values is odd, we add &quot;1&quot; to make it equal. So 21 + 1 = 22. After than we have to divide by 2 to find the place our MEDIAN FREQUENCY is in.</p>
<ul>
<li>22 / 2 . . . 11</li>
<li>11th place</li>
</ul>
<p>The MEDIAN FREQUENCY is in the 11th place. So where is the 11th place? If we side by side compare the set/list values with the frequencys corresponding we can find the 11th place. So:</p>
<p>Lets find out:</p>
<ul>
<li>10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18</li>
<li>05, 02, 04, 01, 04, 02, 00, 01, 02</li>
</ul>
<p>So now we have to get the 11th and 12th place.</p>
<ul>
<li>5 + 2 = 7</li>
<li>7 + 4 = 11</li>
<li>11th</li>
</ul>
<p>So 11th corresponds to the third value. The third value is 12. It is 12, because 7th through 11th are in &quot;12&#x27;s&quot; jurisdiction. I should provide an illustration to show how it is indeed correct. Currently 8:30, I just explained to my dad what and how to get the MEDIAN FREQUENCY. I think he understood, I also did 16 sets of 6 inclined pushups. So 96, anyways. I will relax because I am tired. I spent hours trying to figure out something so simple. But anyways, relaxing time. Ate dinner, now I shall sleep.</p>
<p>Illustration:</p>

<p>Currently 9:00. Slept.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought if I say no, you&#x27;d feel bad&quot;, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know you&#x27;re name so how could I say yes?&quot;, &quot;I was not trying to be mean, you seem like a nice person&quot;, &quot;I gotta go to class, see you in Phys-ed&quot;. Yes, no, maybe? &quot;by implying who are you?&quot;</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="febuary-15th-">Febuary 15th 🎩<a href="#febuary-15th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Febuary 15th 🎩" title="Direct link to Febuary 15th 🎩">​</a></h3>
<p>I went to school, took care of some things. I then played this fun game called &quot;Bench Ball&quot; in P.E. It was fun, we lost 5/5 times though. I don&#x27;t care too much if we lost. Could I have played better? Maybe, did I try my hardest? Maybe, did I have fun? Yeah. But anyways, I will now do 16 sets of 10 inclined pushups. I feel amazing, like I can do anything. Guess being young (13) has its perks like older people say. Currently 4:43. I did it, now 5:00. So 160, not bad. I am getting stronger. But I want to do regular pushups, inclined ones are much easier (I can do 11 regular pushups). Anyways, I will relax for maybe 30 minutes and eat a sandwich.</p>
<p>Currently 5:30, I will study. I will study some math, then biology.</p>
<p>So I take it you see the &quot; n ∑ i = 1 &quot; thing everywhere. It just means that you add up the sums of the first value, to the last.</p>
<p>N = last value</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot; n = 2 &quot; means that you end the summation of numbers up to the second value</li>
</ul>
<p>I = starting/initial value</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot; i = 2 &quot; means that you start the summation of numbers at the second value</li>
</ul>
<p>So n = 5 and i = 1 would mean you add/sum up the 1st through 5th value.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know if people assign n a value, let me check. Im not sure, but anyways.</p>
<p>So if I have a list:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>List:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Find n ∑ i = 3</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Find n = 3 ∑ i = 1</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Find n = i ∑ i = 5</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Find n ∑ i = 9</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Solve for the mean of the list.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright, so lets break this down.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number 1</strong></li>
<li>&quot; Find n ∑ i = 3 &quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>This just means that we need to find the sum of values 3rd till the last one. Since we have ten values, n would be 10 by default. So for question one, we need to find the sum of the 3rd value through the 10th value.</p>
<ul>
<li>3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</li>
<li>3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10</li>
<li>10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 12</li>
<li>40 + 12 . . . 52</li>
<li>The answer for number one is 52</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we found the answer for number one, lets get the rest.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number 2</strong></li>
<li>&quot; Find n = 3 ∑ i = 1 &quot;</li>
<li>Sum values 1 through 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, we have to sum the 1st through the 3rd value.</p>
<ul>
<li>1, 2, 3,</li>
<li>1 + 2 + 3 . . . 6</li>
<li>The answer for number 2 is 6</li>
</ul>
<p>Now to find number three.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number 3</strong></li>
<li>&quot; Find n = i ∑ i = 5 &quot;</li>
<li>Alright, n = i</li>
<li>i = 5</li>
<li>So n = 5</li>
<li>Sum values 5 through 5</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we dont need to do anything, the fifth value is equal to 5.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>1, 2, 3, 4, <em><strong>5</strong></em>, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</em></li>
<li>The answer for number three is 5</li>
</ul>
<p>And then time to find number four.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number 4</strong></li>
<li>&quot; Find n ∑ i = 9 &quot;</li>
<li>n = last value # . . . 10 . . . we have 10 values</li>
<li>We sum the 9th through 10th</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets solve.</p>
<ul>
<li>9 + 10 . . . 19</li>
<li>The answer to number four is 19</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all very straightforward. It is currently 6:20. Anyways, now to find number five.</p>
<ul>
<li>Number 5</li>
<li>&quot; Solve for the mean of the list. &quot;</li>
<li>Add up everything in the list, then divide by the # of values</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</li>
<li>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10</li>
<li>10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 10 . . . 55</li>
<li>55 / 10 . . . 5.5</li>
<li>The mean/answer to number 5 is 5.5</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice. We found all five questions. Why did I do this? So I can have some practice reading these fancy looking symbols. Maybe you were curious too, who knows? Anyways, I will go study with my dad or something. Never ended up doing that, I just made the illustration for yesterdays main problem. Anyways, I recently got into horror comics. It really wasnt that bad, it was creepy, not scary. I feel less scared of real life, because I know these &quot;creatures &quot; arent real. But humans are, there are no demons. Only humans.</p>
<p>I spent an hour reading horror comics, and romance ones. Two extremes, yet I feel nothing. Cool. I really feel like exploring is something that must be done, I thought horror would make me sleepless. Maybe I haven&#x27;t delved deep enough? But do I want to? Maybe, I&#x27;ll take my time. I spent too long on it and even now I am reading. I just read about a city that got nuked, but no buildings were destroyed, only humans. The bodies became slime, and started screaming. The illustrations didn&#x27;t help the creepy vibe simmer down either. When you burn them, smoke comes out. Inhale the smoke, you turn into slime. But you&#x27;re still alive. It is not scary, just odd, creepy, unsettiling. I know it isnt real, so it means nothing to me.</p>
<p>Im gonna eat dinner, then sleep. Would you read horror stories? With pictures/illustrations? I reccomend &quot;Tales of terrible things&quot; By Sara Rydholm. It is light, but cool. Anyways, slept.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="febuary-16th-️">Febuary 16th ❄️<a href="#febuary-16th-️" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Febuary 16th ❄️" title="Direct link to Febuary 16th ❄️">​</a></h3>
<p>I went to school, and walked back. I did not get too much rest last night, or most nights. My back pain keeps me awake. Anyways, I spent an hour just relaxing and eating a sandwich. I wasted time, I should study now. I will study some math things.</p>
<p>Something I dont get is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week, Annand drove an average of 52 miles per day. If the day he drove the longest distance is removed, the average distance he drove in the remaining days becomes 40 miles per day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Solve for longest distance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does this mean? I don&#x27;t know. I believe it means that last week, Annand drove an average of 52 milers per day. If the longest drive was removed, the average would be 40 miles per day. What is the missing/longest value?</p>
<ul>
<li>Week one &quot;Last week&quot;: Average of 52 miles per day</li>
<li>Week two &quot;This week&quot;: Average of 40 miles per day</li>
</ul>
<p>As we know, multiplying the mean by the # of values in a list, then substracting it by the same on the other list, is the missing value. It makes sense if you understand it. You see:</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Missing value (&quot; x &quot;) = Mean 1 * # of values 1 - Mean 2 * # of values 2</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Whatever the difference is, is the answer to the missing value. So lets solve:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are seven days in a week</li>
<li>52 * 7 . . . (50 + 2) * 7 . . . 350 + 14 . . . 364</li>
<li>There are six days if you remove one from the week</li>
<li>40 * 6 . . . 240</li>
<li>Now we substract</li>
<li>364 - 240 . . . 124</li>
<li>x = 124</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, now we know the missing value is 124. The reason why we times by seven for the first average, is because there are 7 days in a week. The reason why we times by six in the second mean is because, a week has 7 days, one less day in a week means 7 - 1 = 6 . . . Yeah. We substract because we need to know the effect the value had on the mean. Something like that. Anyways, I will continue. It is currently 6:30.</p>
<p>According to &quot;weeeeooooo&quot; from KhanAcedemy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot; 25 acres that yielded 40-45 bushels (first bar),
70 acres that yielded 45-50 bushels (second bar),
55 acres that yielded 50-55 bushels (third bar),
20 acres that yielded 55-60 bushels (fourth bar),
5 acres that yielded 60-65 bushels (fifth bar). &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it represents:</p>
<ul>
<li>40-45 bushels - 25 acres</li>
<li>45-50 bushels - 70 acres</li>
<li>50-55 bushels - 55 acres</li>
<li>55-60 bushels - 20 acres</li>
<li>60-65 bushels - 05 acres</li>
</ul>
<p>This just means that acres that yielded 40-45 bushels had a frequency of 25. And acres that yielded 45-50 bushels had a frequency of 70. And so on. So if our MEDIAN FREQUENCY was in the 88th place, it would fall in 45-50&#x27;s jurisdiction. Yup. Anyways, back to work. How is it 88th place? I added all the frequencies, it was 175. The median place of 175 is 88. According to the formula for MEDIAN FREQUENCY:</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">MEDIAN FREQUENCY place/&#x27;th (even) = N/2</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">MEDIAN FREQUENCY place/&#x27;th (odd) = (N + 1) /2</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Since 175 is odd, we add one. So 176. Then find the median of of 176, which is half of itself. So 88. Thus the MEDIAN FREQUENCY, is in the 88th place. Anyways, back to work. Half the month has already passed, wow. Time sure flew.</p>
<p>Wake up, go to school, get back. Do something, sleep. Repeat.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s odd. But what can I do about? I could take my time and feel the hours pass by. I mean 16 days passed by in a blink of an eye. Three years passed by in a minute, I&#x27;m going to highschool soon. Hmmm. Well It will be fun. But I clearly remember being in 6th grade, it was fun. Seventh grade, was alright. And 8th grade was insanely fun. What am I saying, I still am in 8th grade. It just doesn&#x27;t feel like it anymore. I feel more older, and eager to go to highschool. I thought I would stay a middle schooler forever. I always talked about highschool, I never felt like I was going to go there. It&#x27;s almost time before I go.</p>
<p>I still have 5 months left. I&#x27;ll enjoy these months as best I can. While preparing for highschool. I wonder If I&#x27;ll complete highschool in Cannada or the U.S. I could end up moving again, you never know. Anyways, back to work.</p>
<p>I am now on lesson 5 in Khanacedemy S.A.T prep. It is very cool, it&#x27;s stuff we would learn in 8th or 9th. The stuff we will be tested on in S.A.T&#x27;s will be 8th, 9th, and 10th stuff. I believe so at least. I will study some biology stuff.</p>

<p>&quot;Protein A is a structural protein that forms long strands in the cell, while Protein B is a globular protein that functions as an enzyme.&quot;</p>
</blockquote><p>The answer was that they both have different sequences of amino acids. This means, they were &quot;coded&quot; different. They do different things. Amino acid is like code. Whats written determines the shape, size, and functions of everything and anything. I believe I have covered on this a little previously. Anyways.</p><p>The amino acide sequence is determined by the nucleotide sequence. So (theoretically) if nucleotide &quot;G&quot; corresponds to a cell having a square body, the &quot;square body&quot; is a trait derived from the nucleotides. Like code, if you make an object circlular. The object being &quot;circle&quot; is a trait given by the codes function or making the object round. Get it? Well it&#x27;s fine if you dont. My example was not very great, I could not find any other example. Just know that these traits are responsible for our hair color, eye color, and etc.</p></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary><p>DNA (stuff)</p></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>DNA contatins nucleotides. Not amino acids. Proteins are made of amino acids, but DNA does not contains amino acids. Amino acids are required for the making/combining of proteins. They get matched wiht codons (three nucleotides) to form a chain called a protein or polypeptides. It is important.</p><p>According to medlineplus.gov:</p><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Amino acids are molecules that combine to form proteins.&quot;</p>
</blockquote><p>Quinoa is packed with amino acids and is very healthy. Anyways. DNA has genes, genes have information. This information can be about anything, including how to make proteins. The proteins are important in day to day life.</p><p>What is a gene?</p><ol>
<li>A gene is a sequence of nucleotides found within a larger DNA molecule</li>
<li>A gene is a sequence of amino acids found within a larger protein molecule</li>
<li>A gene is a sequence of proteins found within a larger DNA molecule</li>
</ol><p>The correct answer was 1. Why? Because gene has information, information is DNA, DNA is essentially nucleotides. And nucleotides are found within a larger DNA molecule. The name of the molecule holding information/nucleotides is &quot;DNA molecule&quot;. This does not mean that DNA is larger than chromosomes. The order of smallest to largest is gene, dna, chromosome.</p><p>A gene is a stretch of nucleotides. A gene cods for the sequence of amino acids. This also means that technically genes code for proteins. DNA contains genes, that code for proteins. Parts of DNA code for the functions of different molecules, this is specialization. How 2 change specialization? Express (change/remove) some genes.</p></div></div></details></div></div></details>
<p>Currently 7:17. Now 7:48. I will continue studying. It goes from CELLS to TISSUES to NODES to SYSTEMS to an organism like us. Nodes are made up of tissues, and systmes are made from nodes (bunchs of tissue). Cells make up tissues. A structure made up of two or more tissues organized to perform a certain function is an organ. Because it is a collection (more than 1) of tissues that do a spesific function. Organisms contain organ systems.</p>
<p>It is now 8:00, I will relax. Then sleep. Currently 10:30, it is late so I will sleep.</p>

<p>I woke up, it is now 8:43. The only thing that wont betray you are your efforts. The only thing you can count on is your knowledge. The only person with you 24/7 is yourself. If you cant trust yourself, dont trust others to do the same. Ah whatever, I will do something now.</p>
<p>This is all stuff I am writing as notes. I read most of it from KhanAcedemy and decided to jot it down. I also added some random lines explaining what was said proir/former to the information. Get it? I dont either.</p>
<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary><p>Bio things learned today</p></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary><p>Organ/body (stuff)</p></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>If someone has inflamed lungs, their breathing efficiency will go down. And there will be less oxygen in the body. This is bad, the heart would have to go faster/harder to adjust to the rising demand of oxygen. This strains the heart. All the organ systems rely on each other, our body needs oxygen. The organ could swap out the deffective cells/tissues for epethelial cells, but this would not restore it fully. You can swap out a part of code thats not working for a different peice of code, but that code would not be as effective as the original code that broke. If you fix the existing code, instead of replacing. The functionality would increase. Bad example.</p><p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is that swapping the connective tissue for another type of tissue (the epethelial one) would work, but it wont work as well as the connective tissue. It would work, just not as well. But why dont we put connective tissue in there instead? You cant grow back connective tissue instantly, its like a wound. It needs time to heal. You know how there is this thin layer of skin after a wound starts to heal? Well think of the epethelial cell as a placeholder or temporary fail-safe to ensure it does not entirely stop working. Something like that.</p><p>Moving on, if someone has a disorder that affects the bladder, it would be bad. Because they would have trouble storing urine. This would also cause strain on the kidneys. The kidneys clean the liquids in the body, then the waste is sent to the bladder to be removed. If the storage of the waste were to get damaged, where would all that waste go? Only small amounts would get to the point of being removed, the rest would be blocked/clogged on the way to the bladder. The pipe connecting the kidney to the bladder is called the ureters.</p><p>Just like the lung example. The bladder can compensate the damage with other types of tissues. But it cannot make up for the loss in productivity. What if we make the kidney&#x27;s improve to compensate for the bladders issues? No, it would not fully make up for the (fully operational) bladder. This is very random. But anyways.</p><p>The lungs have many types of tissuse. The lungs elastic connective tissue and endothelial tissue, make up the walls of capillaries. Capillaries are small blood vessels that transport and supply oxygen and nutrients to different parts of the body, they also take carbondioxide and waste out of a cell. The fibroblast cell provides proteins to the lungs to enhance elasticity and structure. The fibroblast cell just provides proteins that let the lung be able to expand without losing structure. Elestic connective tissue lets the cell expand and contract.</p><p>Connective tissue, tissue that connects. It can keep in place/hold together other tissues. Such as muscle tissue, the structures that have muscle tissue are held together by the connective tissue. It is useful. A muscle fascicles are made of skeletal muscle fibers. Tendons only have connective tissue.</p><p>Our skin is an organ, with countless cells. Amoung those cells, there are keratinocytes and melanocytes. Keratinocytes produce the protein keratin, which makes our top-layer skin stronger. Melanocytes produce melanin, which gives our skin its pigmentation/color and also helps protect us against UV radiation.</p><p>The sperm cell, has a tail called the &quot;flagellum&quot;. It helps the cell move around. The nucleus/info is stored in the &quot;head&quot; of the cell. It looks like ()---. The () as the head, and the -- as the tail. Genes are made of nucleotides.</p><p>Alpha cell, pancreatic exocrine tissue, pancreas, endocrine system. The alpha cell makes up 30-40% of endocrine cells. The exocrine tissue makes up more than 95% of pancreatic tissue. The Pancrea is made up of exocrine and endocrine cells. The pancrea is made of α, β, δ, ε, and PP cells. Or refered to normally as: alpha, beta, delta, epsilon, and upsilon cells. And alpha is 30-40% of the endocrine cells. Also exocrine tissue is makes up more than 95% of the pancreatic tissue. You follow what Im saying? Yup.</p></div></div></details><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary><p>Cell (stuff)</p></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>Cell divsion, what is it? It is where the cell splits up into two &quot;daughter&quot; cells. Each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent/orignal cell. This act is called &quot;Mitosis&quot;. Chromosomes are long strands of DNA, they are replicated in the procces.</p><p>According to Genomics Education Programme:</p><blockquote>
<p>&quot;The chromosomes in a homologous pair each have the same genes in the same order, but there may be variation between them, resulting in different alleles. Some of the variants in these alleles might have functional implications while others will not.&quot;</p>
</blockquote><p>This means that a homologous chromosome pair had the same genes in the same order, but there might be differences between them. This will result in different alleles. Alleles are like sections of a chromosome. They are small parts that affect things, like how big an animal&#x27;s muscles would be. Or eye color. It is just a clump of DNA and genes that have a say in traits. Currently 7:20 as Im writing this.</p><p>Yeah. Anyways, how does mitosis occur? Well imagine you have a cell. That cell duplicates everything inside itself and now looks crowded. It then begins to split, the chromosomes are sisters. The sister chromosomes get pulled apart and the cell splits into two identical child/daughter cells. It then begins to grow back the nucleus/nucleaur envelope. So it goes from:</p><p>( . O ) to ( : @ ) to ( . o )--( o .) to (. o) (. o) then to  ( . O )  ( . O )</p><p>Yup, makes sense? Yeah. Anyways, chromosomes are located in the nucleus. They contain many genes (hundreds to thousands of them). Here is a quote:</p><p>According to NIH (national institute of health):</p><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Each chromosome contains a single very long, linear DNA molecule. In the smallest human chromosomes this DNA molecule is composed of about 50 million nucleotide pairs; the largest chromosomes contain some 250 million nucleotide pairs. The diploid human genome is thus composed of 46 DNA molecules of 24 distinct types.&quot;</p>
</blockquote><p>The chromosome is one insanely long (unfathomably so) DNA molecule, with some helpful proteins. It is about 6 feet to 2 meters.</p><p>According to KhanAcedemy:</p><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Each cell of a diploid organism contains chromosomes in pairs, with one set of chromosomes inherited from each parent.&quot;</p>
</blockquote><p>Yeah, we have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Meaning we each have 43 chromosomes. Off course sometimes that isn&#x27;t the case. Homologous chromosomes are pairs, one chromasome from the parent. These pairs have/carry the same genes, but are/have slight differences in the alleles of the genes. Homologous chromosomes carry the same set of genes.</p><p>According to the NHGRI (national human genome research institue):</p><blockquote>
<p>&quot;A gamete is a reproductive cell of an animal or plant. In animals, female gametes are called ova or egg cells, and male gametes are called sperm. Ova and sperm are haploid cells, with each cell carrying only one copy of each chromosome. During fertilization, a sperm and ovum unite to form a new diploid organism.&quot;</p>
</blockquote><p>Diploid is where the cell has 2 identical daughter cells. A haploid cell is where the cell only has one copy of the parent cell. Ova has 13 pairs of chromosomes, the sperm has 13 pairs of chromosomes too. They both get together to have in total 23 pairs, these 23 pairs are responsible for the human. You know, us. One half, plus another halve. Equals 1 whole doesn&#x27;t it? Haploids are halves, diploid is full/whole. I mean thats not totally acurate but, somewhat true yes. Human gametes are the egg and sperm cell. Gametes are formed through meiosis.</p><p>According to BYJUS:</p><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Meiosis is a type of cell division during which a single cell divides twice and produces four daughter cells. These four daughter cells contain half the amount of genetic material and are known as our sex cells (gametes).&quot;</p>
</blockquote><p>So imagine you one whole, divide into halves. Then divide again. Left with 1/4 of a cell? No. Are we left with four 1/4&#x27;s of a cell? No. Are we left with four cells? Yep, it divided, not in math, but in biology. I think.</p><p>According to NIH:</p><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mitosis is a type of cell division for somatic cells and for the asexual reproduction of unicellular eukaryotic cells. Meiosis is the type of cell division for the production of gametes in sexual reproduction&quot;</p>
</blockquote><p>Yeah. Somatic cells are EVERY other cell than gametes. Asexual reproduction is where the cell/thing would reproduce without a partner. I believe plants can do this. There are also MANY many animals capable of this. Wow, I never knew. I thought only plants do asexual reproduction. But like bees, wasps, lizzards, snakes, scorpions, etc can do this. Some animals can also do both asexual, and sexual reproduction. Thats crazy, some plants can do both too! This is why I find biology so intresting.</p><p>Some plant cells are unicellular eukaryotic cells, while others arent. The same goes with animal cells, they can also be multicellur or unicellular.</p></div></div></details></div></div></details>
<p>Ate breakfeast, then an orange. Now 9:49. I will continue doing something. Currently 10:14, I spent some time talking with my grandparents.</p>
<p>I just spent an hour playing &quot;Helldivers 2&quot;, it is beyond amaing. When did games become so graphicaly/everything-ly good? Helldivers is very different from what you&#x27;d expect, it is like being there yourself. You know those movies about aleins and wars. This game is crazy good, I made the mistake of playing a end game difficulty stage. It was so intense, this game is detailed and honestly if I had to choose a game to get good at, this would be it. Of course I&#x27;m focusing on my studies now. But damn that was a rush playing the game.</p>
<p>Worried about cost? Just buy the PS pass, if a game costs $80, get it for much less using the PS pass. Using the PS pass you can play lots of games without paying for them. &quot;IT COSTS MONEY TO GET THE PASS&quot;, well it costs more to buy a nice game. So why not spend a little extra, to get 100+ games. Than a lot, to get 1?</p>
<p>I was just ranting, anyways. Back to work, currently 11:30. Now 12:00, just relaxed and played music. I kinda couldve done some studying but oh well. There is snow outside, it is also very sunny.</p>

<p>This is cool, anyways, I will go eat. Just came back, it is currently 1:00. I am full, my mother made paneer. It was delecious. I also ate a chocolate called mars. Anyways, back to work. If you think about it, it has been 2 months since the year started. Felt like it started yesterday. Anyways. You can put anything in anything. You can layer anything inside anything! It is really cool the amount of creative freedom code lets you have.</p>

<p>Yeah, well I&#x27;ll get back to work now. Currently 1:20, wrote some more in the &quot;biology stuff learned today&quot;. Currently 2:50. It is a snow blizzard outside. Outside my window is pure white. Nothing is visible. Currently 3:10, it is now sunny outside. Currently 3:40, got to unit 2 lesson 1. Highschool biology (KhanAcedemy) is picking up.</p>
<p>Currently 5:30, I took a bath, relaxed, excercied. And did other things, like eating magi noodles. Anyways, I will study practice S.A.T problems with my father.</p>
<p>It is now 7:15. Two hours later, I learned about functions and how to solve things like &quot;6^8 y^2 + 12x^2 y^2&quot;. Well not exactly, but anyways. I will relax for now? I did not relax, I just studied biology. I learned about cell division. Currently 7:40, I will relax, then eat dinner.</p>
<p>I ate dinner, it was homemade tacos. They had sausage, tuna, egg, and salsa. It was delicious. Anyways. I will relax then sleep. Currently 9:50, I brushed. I also put oil on my hair, my hair is very long. I am a man (boy) with a lions mane for hair. But anyways, I am just listening to music.</p>

<p>Currently 8:11. I just woke up, it is sunday today. I wrote a fair bit yesterday and I plan on doing even more today. If possible. Now 8:30, spent some time reading the notes I made yesterday. I will now study I think. I did not study, I worked on the website. I fixed broken links and made the front page nicer. I also made some adjustsments to stupid mistakes. I named &quot;extras&quot; blog, and blog &quot;category&quot;. I should really change the id/name/whatever. I also wrote some stuff in the dev-log. Here is what it looks like now:</p>

<p><em>Screenshot of this websites Feb 2024 front page</em></p>
<p>It&#x27;s a work in progress okay? It could be better but idk. I like green and yellow. Currently 9:04, I will brush then eat breakfeast. Currently 10:07, I ate breakfeast, then played a mission in helldivers. It&#x27;s my new favorite game, it is so intense and having a party member to play with is crazy fun. I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like it, but it is so detailed and relistic. It&#x27;s like your really in there. Was I paid to say this? No im 13. Give it a try.</p>
<p>Anyways, I will study. Math. I did not study math, I instead decided to purchase a headphones. It was from RAZER, my old ones broke. So I decided to get a nicer one. This one will last years (hopefuly). Now I&#x27;ll study math.</p>

Anyways, bar graphs. The size of the bar represents it&#x27;s value. So the longer or taller the bar is, the bigger the value of the &quot;bar&quot; is. Here is a bar graph question:</p><blockquote>
<p>Your cat has graphed the amount of times you, your freind, and best friend have said &quot;no&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; today.</p>

<p>You: yes = 3 , no = 9</p>

<ol>
<li>Solve for the mean of yes&#x27;s and no&#x27;s (Ex: 1 and 2)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Find the range of yes&#x27;s and no&#x27;s (Ex: 1 to 2, and 3 to 4)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Are there more yes&#x27;s or no&#x27;s in total? (Ex: 1 &lt; 2 so yes/no)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote><p>Lets solve, so we know the yes&#x27;s and no&#x27;s. We need to find the mean, range, and if there are more yes&#x27;s or no&#x27;s. Lets solve number 1:</p><ul>
<li>Number 1</li>
<li>Yes mean: (3, 13, 4) / 3 . . . (3 + 13 + 4) / 4 . . . 20 / 3 . . . 6 2/3</li>
<li>No mean: (9, 2, 11) / 3 . . . (9 + 2 + 11) / 3 . . . 22 / 3 . . . 7 1/3</li>
</ul><p>We found out yes mean = 6 2/3. And the no mean = 7 1/3. That means we found the answer to 2 questions.</p><ul>
<li>1: 6 2/3 and 7 1/3</li>
<li>3: 20 &lt; 22 so there are more no&#x27;s in total</li>
</ul><p>We just need to find the range to solve/answer the second one.</p><ul>
<li>Range = max - min</li>
<li>10 = 13 - 3</li>
<li>9 = 11 -2</li>
</ul><p>Alright, just found the ranges. That solves the second one. These are all very straighforward, I dont know what I was thinking making it so easy.</p><ul>
<li>2: 13 to 3 (10) and 11 to 2 (9)</li>
</ul><p>Yup, that was simple. Anyways. I will do something.</p></div></div></details></div></div></details>
<p>I just did 80 inclined pushups nonstop. My arms feel tired, I suppose intensity is a good compensation for less time spent on an exsecise. Anyways, back to work. Currently 11:30, I don&#x27;t know. Am I wasting my time? Should I be spending time with my family? Yeah, I should. I will relax for a bit, then study.</p>
<p>I spent some time with my parents, I then made pizza with my mother. I afterwards ate the pizza, I enjoyed the pizza. I then wrote this. It is currently 2:00, I will do something.</p>
<p>Currently 8:40, how did we get here? So, I excersiced for a while, then relaxed, then excercied. I then made my younger brother cry. As punishment, my father took away my laptop and phone for a while. In that while, I spent 2 hours playing monopoly with my younger brother, I had all properties and had many hotels on them. I also drew and played with magnets. Well I got my laptop back just now. Anyways, I will brush then sleep. Yup.</p>
<p>I brushed. Now I will relax then sleep.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="febuary-19th-">Febuary 19th ⏳<a href="#febuary-19th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Febuary 19th ⏳" title="Direct link to Febuary 19th ⏳">​</a></h3>
<p>Currently 8:00. After some deep thinking at night, I figured out what meiosis is! Okay, so imgine a cell has 2 chromosomes, if it replicates/duplicates inside itself. How many chromosomes would be in the cell? Four, because double of two would be four. So then what if we split it in 4? How many cells would we have? We would have 4 cells, each with 1/2 of a normal cells chromosome count. It is haploid now.</p>
<p>I will make an ilustration:</p>

<p>Screenshot from something I made in google slides. It took less than 20 minutes. I searched it up after I made this, I was indeed correct. Imagine if I had been wrong. It would be 20 min down the drain.</p>
<p>Currently 10:03. I spent some time playing monopoly with my brother and ate breakfeast. I will now do something. <sub>Hello, this is some <del>big</del> <ins>small</ins> text!</sub></p>
<p>Anyways, I will continue to <sup>do</sup> something. What is 2<sup>4</sup>? I <del>dont</del> know 16. But I do know that this is <mark>very </mark> useful.</p>

<p>Im just testing these out, and putting random dialogue in them. <bdo dir="rtl">I learned most of these random things by courtesy of &quot;w3schools&quot;. It is pretty cool.</bdo></p>
<p>Read it right to left then it says: &quot;I learned most of these random things by courtesy of &quot;w3schools&quot;. It is pretty cool.&quot; It is a website with info on html.</p>
<p><button>HELLO</button>
.</p>
<p>Did you click it? It does nothing. Currently 12:00, I spent some (1 hour and a half) with my dad learning biology/genology. It is very intresting and looks cool. I learned about gene arrays and how they work. Currently, <del>1:59</del> <ins>2:00</ins>. I spent an hour or more playing monopoly till 1:00, then I ate lunch. I also started watching Naruto Shippuden. What will I do now? Im not quite sure, I will check if I have homework. Two minutes later, I do not have homework, instead-I have a math test tomorrow. Great.</p>
<p>It is about multiplying and dividing fractions. It is not too difficult. If you know how to solve them. Should I practice to not fail the test? No, no I should not study. Why? I don&#x27;t wanna, I will procrastinate by excersing. Yup. Be back in an hour. Currently 2:38, I excercied a bit. Anyways, now I will study. :(</p>
<p>Did not study. I played minecraft for an hour (or two). My headphones arrived! It took one day, wow! I just played some music. It is incredible, the quality feels amazing too. <!-- -->:D</p>
<p>Lets gooooo. It sounds so good. I will study with them. I studied for my test a little bit. I relised that I need to read the question before answering. Good thing I practiced. I have to say, I am impressed with the sound quality. It is really comfortable. It isn&#x27;t fully noise canceling either. Which is good because I need hearing.</p>
<p>Now Im gonna, study math things other than fractions. I forget to mention, we got our report cards on friday (feb 16th). I had mostly good grades. Like mostly b&#x27;s and b+&#x27;s. I turned in all assignments, all work. I did everything, but why didn&#x27;t I get all A&#x27;s? I did not show my work &quot;neatly&quot; in math. I did not have proper grammer in french. I was surprised by my grades. I thought I would get an automatic A&#x27;s across the board. I got so used to getting A&#x27;s, that when I came here. I got complacent, just doing the work is not enough I&#x27;ve learned. Tests are like 80-90% of our grade. I made minor mistakes in most of the tests. Maybe thats why. Well Im not sure about french. I got a C, what do you expect? It&#x27;s the first time I have ever even writen/properly spoken french. But I guess I could&#x27;ve done better? I mean math, I did not pay any attention, nor was I quiet in class. I would always be laughing in class with my buddy. Maybe thats why I didn&#x27;t get an A?</p>
<p>Anyways, enough about my grades. They <ins>will</ins> be better next time. Back to work. Currently 5:30. I do not want the long weekend to end. I have school tomorrow. I like school, but I like home better. You know?</p>

<p>Currently 6:00, I am lazy. I don&#x27;t know but I do not want to do work. I am tired? Why? Well I&#x27;ve mostly been goofing off. If I fight someone, can I win? I am like 5,9 , not weak. But can I fight? No not really, so how would I do in a fight. I want to get into boxing, it looks fun. But would I be an good at it? I dont know. These are random thoughts, I have never been in a real fight. I never had to, but what if I did? Then what? Would I win? Probably, Im not sure.</p>
<p>I took a shower, and came across something ... and it made me think. I looked in my bathroom mirror, for the first time in my life. I thought, what a strange creature. I got scared, why? I don&#x27;t know, I looked into my own eyes and saw nothing but black. I have black eyes and black hair. Really deep black hair, its quite nice. Anyways, It occured to me. &quot;How are we so different from a lowly chicken&quot;? In truth we are not, we are both animals. Humans are scary, humans are tall hairless monkey&#x27;s. Imagine coming accros one trying to kill you, strange, odd, scary? Well I saw myself as an animal for the first time. &quot;is that my body&quot;? Yeah, it was. We are animals, we want to reproduce, we want to survive. You see an attractive person, why do you think they are attractive? WHY DONT YOU FIND A ZEBRA ATTRACITVE? I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s strange. We are strange, the intricacy and complexity of life itself puzzles me. To no avail have I thought, what am I? Who am I, is who a thing? Is who just a made up thing, arent we all human? Human 1, human 2, human 3 . . . human 700000000. No, we are unique? Why do we live life thinking about immaterial things? Maybe because it isn&#x27;t irrelevant to ourselves. Why are these things relevant to one&#x27;s self? Society? Well society is us, we make up society. We only have ourselves to blame? &quot;No, it was not my fault&quot;! How do we think/rationalize these complex things? Strategies, war, maths. We are big hairless chickens? The only thing seperating us, and monkeys, zebras, lions, and other animals. Is our DNA, our genes. What we are. We, I, us, them? Are... is odd. How am I typing, what is a creature, an animal, doing with all this power? Our brains are a gift from heaven, otherwise, we would be some other animals livestock. Imagine being a lamb going to slaughter, scary? You know no fear, you know no language, you&#x27;ve lived no fine life. You know not of what life is, neither do humans.</p>
<p>Well, anyways, I will go pray. I finished praying, currently 7:00. I will spend time with my family. We are <del>demons</del> humans. It&#x27;s funny, ghosts, &quot;monsters&quot;, and other stuff don&#x27;t exist. Only we do, of course maybe somewhere out there, there could be some genetic freak of a beast in a lab. But, we would have created it. Only the things created can be real, I plan to create life. I haven&#x27;t made my demons yet, they don&#x27;t need to haunt you. Human in itself is real, so why do we believe what is not there. If ghosts were real, we could not see them, nor hear them. If anything, you should be afraid of humans, but get so strong no human can mess with you. Ignore that, It was random.</p>
<p>If you believe in ghosts, don&#x27;t, they don&#x27;t exist, not yet. It is lonely, no, you have yourself keeping you company. You, your mind, your thoughts. They count. If anyone needed to hear this, cool. Why am I writing this? To remind myself ghosts are not real. The black shadow at night is your own shadow, no one elses&#x27;.</p>
<p>Currently 8:23, I watched tv and ate dinner. We got so used to things, we (?) are human, we adapt very quickly. Our environment, it is unatural, until natural. Pretty sure 50 years from now, this will all be natural. Unless we do something, like what? Im not sure, we could start a base of mars. We could start mining asteroids, we could do anything? That or, we unlock flight, make 10+ story buildings everywhere. Making room for more plants down below. Imagine if all one story houses were removed. It would clear up so, so much space. But I don&#x27;t know. Just food for thought.</p>
<p>Currently 9:00, spent some time working on my english essay. I am very happy with it, it turned out quite nice. Anyways, I will probably relax then go sleep. Worked on it some more, I should go brush. I have school tomorrow. Today is monday by the way, it is a long weekend. I sometimes randomly have crazy thoughts, it&#x27;s funny. At least I can write this somewhere. Right me?</p>
<p>Enough of that, I <ins>will</ins> brush.</p>
<p>I spent like an hour brushing, well not entirely. I spent some time on my skin care routine. Then I went downstairs, to fill water in my bottle. I also left my brush down there. My skin care routine consists of; washing my face, putting acne cream, washing acne cream. I have so much acne, I look manly but acne full. It&#x27;s funny, I look like I&#x27;m <del>17</del> 15 , my face is very masculine. I apparently look like a &quot;caveman&quot;. A lot of kids my age look baby-ish (kid-ish), but I had puberty early. Just because lots of kids look like baby&#x27;s, does not mean there arent lots of strong masculine kids. Lots of kids are weak, lots of kids are strong. I am not strong for my build, I could be much stronger. I just look strong, my shoulders and chest are big. That&#x27;s mostly thanks to genetics, my family/ancestors were army men. My grandpa served close to 40 years in the military. He is an amazing role model because he is someone strong. My dad is my role model too, he works hard everyday, to ensure we are happy.</p>
<p>My point being, there is always someone better, always someone lower. If you remove yourself from the race, everyone is equal. Life is not a race? Most of it is, but take it how you will. I should stop writing so much random stuff here. Maybe some things are best left unsaid. But anyways, off to bed.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="febuary-20th-">Febuary 20th ⌛<a href="#febuary-20th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Febuary 20th ⌛" title="Direct link to Febuary 20th ⌛">​</a></h3>
<p>I did not have a math test today, instead I had an amazing day that was really fun. Another thing that happened was, the girl who asked me to be her valentine told me that I broke her heart. I felt bad, I felt really bad. I am not planning to date anyone right now, I have high standards. I want whoever I date, to be; mature, taller than 5 ft, nice, polite, hangs out with me often. But right now, I am not ready for a relationship, I mean honestly, what good is one now? I am 13, I am tall, nice, and polite. I&#x27;m glad I look attractive, but at the same time, It feels bad having to reject a girl. I know some of you reading will be like, &quot;STFU your just flexing&quot;, well be realistic. I am a good person, I trust myself. How can I trust someone I just met? There are many factors. I do think she is very pretty, but pretty is not enough. I am &quot;handsome&quot;, but I am also a good person. I know many people who are ugly and rude, no one likes them. Except ugly rude people. How do you be handsome? Be the best person you can be, that affects your mind, which in turn affects your body.</p>
<p>All I&#x27;m saying is, good people don&#x27;t finish last. Great people finish first, be a great person. I strive to be the best damn &quot;person&quot; I can be. You should too. Afraid of looking small and weak? Make freinds with a strong person, I will protect my friends. Strong people aren&#x27;t just physically strong, but also you can count on them. Being polite, and being <ins>better</ins> is always a good thing. Excersise can make you humble, strong, but you need to be someone others can count on. I consider myself dependable. I have absolute faith in myself, I wont compromise on my values just to look &quot;cool&quot;. It is far more cool to stick to your values. You don&#x27;t need youtube videos to tell you this, just be a better person. Thats it.</p>
<p>Anyways, as I was saying. If I had said yes to being her valentine, she might&#x27;ve expected me to date her. I&#x27;d rather not break anyones hearts. But if she gets to know me and likes me, and then I reject her, would that not be much worse than a stranger telling you no? Think about it, I could be wrong though. Only time, or someone smarter than me can tell. Either way, I will do some homework now.</p>
<p>Off topic, being a great person is not enough either. Be fit, be masculine, be strong. I want to be manly, it is a goal I will succed.</p>
<p>Wow, it is currently 6:00, time flew. I wrote like five pages. It is now 7:00-ish. I watched Tv for about an hour. I will now finish some homework. Just checked, my french teacher sent me a message saying. &quot;You used google translate, I saw highschool level verbs in there, so redo it.&quot; Something along those lines. I&#x27;m never trusting the suggestions from google. When you write something, it says a suggestion. As a person new to french, I thought that all the suggestions google is giving me were correct. And they indeed were, but the suggestions were too good. It was my fault for trusting google. BUT I wrote most, if not all the words from looking at a french dictionary. Like my teacher asked me too. I feel cheated, but the report cards are already in. No wonder I got a 68%. :(</p>
<p>But anyways, Im just doing french homwork right now. It is not fun, I doubt I will continue french honestly. When/if I move back to the US after/in between highshcool. I will probably learn spanish. Hola amigo, eres tu mi amigo? I will get back to work. Currently 7:54, I finsihed my french work. I even wrote that I did not use google translate.</p>
<p>I will relax for a bit. I read, at dinner. Then read, I will continue to do my english work. It is really fun.</p>
<p>Slept</p>

<p>I woke up, it is wendsday.</p>
<bdo dir="rtl">&quot;Don&#x27;t feel bad, I don&#x27;t know you well enough. These things take time, how can I trust you. It&#x27;s funny, on valentines, when I saw you. I imediatly thought to myself &#x27;what a beautiful girl&#x27;. But, you see being pretty isn&#x27;t enough, I have to know you first. You barely know anything about me, nor I you. Plus, I have impossibly high standards. If I was any other guy I would&#x27;ve said yes, in fact when you asked me I said yes in my head like 10 times. But, I don&#x27;t know enough about you to make that deciosion. You could be a great person, but I would not know till we get to know each other.&quot;</bdo>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Never mind this, it&#x27;s just some brainstorming. I probably won&#x27;t even date till highschool. We are still 13, neither I, nor most kids my age have matured enough.</p>
<p>Currently 4:40, I just came back from school. Today I slipped in mud, it got my clothes all dirty. I walked here, it took an hour and a half. I was mostly talking along the way. When I got home, I stepped into mud. I was sinking in the mud and once I got out, I noticed my shoes were all muddy. I went to some snow and cleaned them off, it was squeeky clean. Who knew snow could clean so well, it is water after all.</p>
<p>I will excerise, then relax. Then study. I ended up not doing any of that. I watched for 15 minutes a video about collage from a local highschool. I did absolutly nothing today. It is currently 6:30, I regret just wasting time relaxing. I dont even feel relaxed. I want to exersise, but I want to study. I will study for a little bit, then excersise. Damn it, I will get back to work. Tomorrow I will do lots of things. But today I need to focus.</p>
<p>I studied with my dad till like 8:30, it was very useful. I relize that I don&#x27;t know enough things. I will study harder tomorrow. Right now I ate dinner, and I am doing french homework. Currently 10:16, I will sleep afterwards.</p>
<p>Slept.</p>

<p>I woke up, it is thursday. I have a math test today. <!-- -->:D</p>
<p>Got back, currently 4:13, I took the math test. It was pretty simple. Nothing too difficult. I had a lot of fun today, I like school. Being social is the best part of school, I enjoy being outgoing. You should too. Want to be freinds with someone, talk to them. I pulled out my phone in class and did some things. My teacher was fine with, I even showed her a photo on my phone. The photo was a group photo of our class. I was in there. When I got back to my seat, my freind was in shock how I was allowed to take out my phone. We aren&#x27;t prisoners, nor do we have be a slave to other peoples opinions.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m the loudest person in the room, embarassment is for stupid things/occurences. If you are being bullied, and think it is embarressing, dont be. Getting bullied always seems like something that would happen to a loser, but that is not always true. You can be the strongest person, but still be bullied if no one likes you. Make people like you, make freinds. You are more likely to be safe around a group of freinds. Nothing bad comes from making friends.</p>
<p>This is controversial, but I believe that being shy does not exist. Thats just being scared or small, be brave and big. Everyone likes a good person, bad people don&#x27;t wanna hang out with a good person. It makes them feel worthless, but around other bad people, it is normal. If everyone is equally bad, no one is. But some are good, some are bad, the differences show, the outline becomes clear. &quot;There is no good and bad&quot; be quiet, there are good habits/actions/behaviors/traits. A bad trait/habit is being rude, that isn&#x27;t personality, thats just being a bad person. Be better, be stronger.</p>
<p>Easy for me to say, I have a good life. I have a good life because I did not mess it up. It isn&#x27;t bad to have a good life, messing up your life ain&#x27;t cool. Today, someone vandalized the school bathroom. So from now on, we will have to use another bathroom for like two months. Because one person did something stupid, we all have to suffer. I&#x27;d rat out the person who did it, than have to suffer from someone elses wrong doing. This is not cool, this is just being dumb. I will find out who did it and make them confess. Either that or I&#x27;ll... This is a blog.</p>
<p>Most likely he&#x27;ll turn himself in, the people in canada are nice. But social media really ducked up OUR generation. The internet is ruining kids these days, as a kid. I would know, people think it is cool to be a jerk. On another note. It is funny, some wannabe (pretend thug) ramed into me, fell over and started cussing me out. He walked away, he was half my height and thought he was tough. It was funny, someone so weak pretending to be all that. As a &quot;strong&quot; person, I choose to be a good person. I am &quot;strong&quot;, because I am stronger than a lot of kids at my school. This does not mean I am physically too strong. I admit I need to work on my strength. But I enjoy being nice, it makes me feel better about myself.</p>
<p>If you hate yourself, nothing matters. If you love youself, everything matters. No, you can hate yourself, just don&#x27;t hate the people around you. You can stop hating yourself, but you can&#x27;t stop the damage you made from saying stupid things. You can&#x27;t stop people from feeling hurt or offended. You can stop yourself. You control you, and nobody else. If you have kids, they should listen to you. Anyways, this was random.</p>
<p>I just wanted to say that being a good person is always the way to go, if your friends are all bad. Be good, it shows good on you. Or don&#x27;t be friends with bad people, I know I have said previously that it does not matter who you make friends with. This is indeed true, just don&#x27;t get too close to them. Anyways, I will get back to work.</p>
<p>I did not get back to work and istead wasted 30 minutes just playing games. I regret it so much, but I know I might do it again. I will stay on the path of god. I did 20 pushups, poorly. But this is progress. I strive to do more. Only thing is that the oxygen or something does not flow to my head. So it makes my head feel weird. I don&#x27;t know, maybe it is my breathing technique? Anyways, now I will do some homework. I spent like an hour on my school project so far, it looks great.</p>
<p>I finished, I did almost all the work. Why? Because I don&#x27;t trust them to do it properly. It may be selfish but I have my reasons. Anyways, I will take a break. Currently 6:21. I ate some broccoli pakorda, it was really tasty. I also watched some tv. Right now, I have to work on homework. I do not want to work on french, I do not care. But it is graded, I used to liked french, but I don&#x27;t know why I dislike it now. Maybe because I am not very good at it, that&#x27;s probably it.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to work. I know I said I will learn more about functions and other things today. But I do not have time for that. I need to finsih school work first, then extra stuff later. It is currently 7:46, I am just working on another school project. I swear it&#x27;s just one school project after another. But I mean it is good practice, certianly better than homework. I am currently researching on a man named John Ware. He was a black cowboy who became a legend in the ranching and herding buisness in the 18 hundreds. He was a strong person. I need to make a slide deck about him, luckily there is lots of info on him.</p>
<p>Currently 10:00, I ate dinner. And have been working on the project for a little while. It is fun, doing projects is better than homework. It feels like a good use of time. I did not get to do as much as I wanted to today. But after I get this project done with, I will have all the time to study other things. Finishing my school things takes priority. Anyways, I will go spend time with my family. School and studying is not our purpose in life, it is a means to a goal. Just as our goal is a mean to be existant and meaningful. But our meaning comes from our goals. You see? Never mind.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="febuary-23rd-">Febuary 23rd 🛝<a href="#febuary-23rd-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Febuary 23rd 🛝" title="Direct link to Febuary 23rd 🛝">​</a></h3>
<p>I went/walked to school. I walked back with my friends, around like 12 of them. I went to a pond with them and asserted our dominance against some geese. Afterwards, we just kept walking and ended up in a park. We played in the park till 4:40. I got back home at 5:00. They taught me a game called grounder&#x27;s after swinging for a bit. Grounders is where everyone goes on the play structure and someone has to get them.The person who is &quot;it&quot;, has to go onto the play structure only if he is closing his eyes. If he says &quot;grounders!&quot; and someone is on the ground, they are it. The goal is not to be touched, or if &quot;it&quot;, it is to touch wihtout getting hurt. Anyways, tt is currently 5:07. I had lots of fun, I enjoy having friends who don&#x27;t care about looking cool. They care about having fun.</p>
<p>Anyways, I will work on my school project. Currently 5:30, spent some time and completed a slide of the project. I learned that John Ware did not get an education. He was born into slavery, and got set free. Anyways, I will get back to work.</p>
<p>It is currently 6:15, I excercied till 6:00. I am now relaxing, yep. Currently 7:00, I just kept relaxing. I spent most of the day just relaxing. The past couple days I have not been doing too much studies. I will work on my school project. Over the weekend I will study. I have more time on the weekends, so y&#x27;know. Finish the school work, then do the learning work. Yup.</p>
<p>Well, currently 7:54. I played minecraft with my younger brother. He jumped in lava, lost all his stuff and blamed me. I made my base hundred of blocks away from his. Yet him dying and losing his stuff is my fault. I did not turn on cheats, it is more fum without them. I played for like an hour, wait no. I helped my mom with the grocceries, then played.</p>
<p>Currently 10:11, I worked on my project. And then ate dinner, then worked on my project. I ate cripy chicken and noodles. My mother is an amazing cook. Anyways, I am currently working on the project. John Ware died from his horse falling on him, the horse tripped and fell on him. He died in 1905, his wife Mildred died before him due to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in the lungs. His kids were very small when he died, he had 6 kids. One died at birth. This is John Ware, the black cowboy.</p>
<p>I will take a break, I am tired. Whew, my vision is blurry. I should go to sleep.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="febuary-24th-">Febuary 24th 🧢<a href="#febuary-24th-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Febuary 24th 🧢" title="Direct link to Febuary 24th 🧢">​</a></h3>
<p>I woke up, spent some time on my project. I think it is almost done. I ate breakfeast and it is now 9:48. I will go talk to my grandparents. It is now 11:08, I talked then relaxed for a bit with my family. We watched some video about superconductivity. It was cool, but anyways. It is already 11:00, so I will do some homework. I think my project is as good as done. Okay, 11:30. I just, y&#x27;know... relaxed. Yeah totally. Anyways, now I will get back to work.</p>
<p>My brother, I wan&#x27;t him to do good. Succed, but that is difficult. I will work on school work. Why? I enjoy doing work, I enjoy doing studying. It makes me feel better, &quot;why does it make you feel better&quot;. Because I don&#x27;t enjoy wasting time, I enjoy spending time. I will not waste the time I have, I wan&#x27;t to feel like I did something. I don&#x27;t enjoy just sitting around or laying doing nothing. It does not feel good. I enjoy thinking deeply, it let&#x27;s me find solutions to problems I faced in the day. But why should wasting time make me feel good? I believe that watching tv, doing these things are not supposed to make you feel good. Feel good by spending time with family, feel good by excersing. I get a rush when I do, I feel great when I excersice. Good things should make you feel good, I&#x27;m all for relaxing. But overdoing anything is bad. Ask any religeon, any person. Overdoing anything is bad. I like feeling productive, it gives my day meaning. My day is my reflection of my actions. I act on my thoughts to excersise or study. I hate regret, it is something I never want to feel. I burn inside when regret comes, it does not go away. Time lost is time that could have been spent.</p>
<p>Listen, you should enjoy life. But life is not about playing games or looking cool. It is about you, you are your own life. And your family are in your life. Your life is your existence, make it meaningful. At least to yourself it should be. To no one else should your life hold meaning but you. Your family, friends, and admirers. What am I saying? Enjoy, being productive. Be happy, eating healthy. I love fruits, they make me feel good. I love compliments, they make me feel good. But why does regret make me feel oh so bad? Because It does not make me happy, it makes me sad. I can&#x27;t explain in mere words how important the things in your head are. What you like should not be based on others, I like soccer. Why? Because it has grown on me. I like trucks, they look cool. I wan&#x27;t to become more knowledgeable, I need to understand. My <del>goal</del> happiness is becoming a better person. Physically or mentally, both matter.</p>
<p>Currently 12:00, I was talking with my mother. Currently 12:30-ish, I watched &quot;The last Airbender&quot; with my family. It had very good graphics. But anyways, back to work.</p>
<p>Mechanical Advantage = Output/Input</p>
<p>I just finished my science homework. Nice, anyways. Now I will relax, relaxing is a reward. I enjoy relaxing, after knowing I have done something. Spent five minutes relaxing, I feel good. Back to work. I have no work, this payed off. Just getting my homework done gives me lots of time to relax or study. I have the rest of the weekend to study. Nice. I&#x27;ll get to it. I really want to understand functions. I need to master them, and exponents.</p>
<p>Functions, what are they? It is where you have a &quot;function&quot; and put a value in there. Such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your friend wants you to pick a number, you pick 9.
Your friend will take the number and multiply it by 10, substact 5, then divide by 10</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the function?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the output?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the function will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>f(x) = (10x - 5)/10</li>
</ul>
<p>But why? Because the value is &quot;x&quot;, and the &quot;f&quot; just means &quot;function&quot;. So we function x, the &quot;function&quot; is = to multiply &quot;x&quot; by 10, substact 5, then divide by 10. That is why it is writen like that. Well what is the output if &quot;x&quot; in function is 9?</p>
<ul>
<li>f(9) = (10x - 5)/10 . . . (90 - 5)/10 . . . 85/10 . . . 8.5</li>
<li>The output = 8.5</li>
</ul>
<p>So function 9 is 8.5, cool. Functions are actually pretty simple. Nice. Here is another one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your best friend decided to make a formula to always get 1000, they want you to see if it works:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>f(x) = ((((x * x) + 10) - x<sup>2</sup> ) * 100) - (x<sup>2</sup> - (((x<sup>2</sup> * 0<sup>x</sup>)) * x<sup>0</sup>) + (x<sup>2</sup>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You choose 5, they say okay</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Solve for f(5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How are we supposed to solve this? Looks so hard right? Simplify it, that&#x27;s it.</p>
<ul>
<li>f(5) = ((((x * x) + 10) - x<sup>2</sup> ) * 100) - (x<sup>2</sup> - (((x<sup>2</sup> * 0<sup>x</sup>)) * x<sup>0</sup>) + (x<sup>2</sup>)</li>
<li>f(5) = ((((5 * 5) + 10) - 25 ) * 100) - (5<sup>2</sup> - (((5<sup>2</sup> * 0<sup>5</sup>)) * 5<sup>0</sup>) + (5<sup>2</sup>)</li>
<li>f(5) = ((((25) + 10) - 25 ) * 100) - (25 - (((25 * 0)) * 1) + (25)</li>
<li>f(5) = (((35) - 25 ) * 100) - (25 - (((0)) * 1) + (25)</li>
<li>f(5) = ((10) * 100) - (25 * 1) + (25)</li>
<li>f(5) = 1000 - 25 + (25)</li>
<li>f(5) = 975 + (25)</li>
<li>f(5) = 1000</li>
</ul>
<p>There, it works. So f(5) = 1000. Cool, anyways. This example was a bit extreme, but that goes to show that anything can be solved if you make it simpler. If I am wrong, correct me. How do you correct me? I&#x27;m not sure, maybe I&#x27;ll make a comment section at the end of each month. How awsome would that be? I will go eat lunch now.</p>
<p>Currently 2:20, I ate lunch at 1:30-ish. I ate pizza, my mother made really really good pizza. Just one slice made me full. Each slice was a foot long. Don&#x27;t believe me? Too bad, it was delicious. Anyways, I just checked. I have music homework to do, dang it. After doing some research about some drums, I have gotten good progress on the assignment. I will take a break. Took a shower, then relaxed for a bit with my dad. Now, I will relax some more. It is currently 3:30, I was supposed to take a break at 3:00, but I took a shower. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, just five minutes I&#x27;ll take a break. Currently 4:00, my break was more than five minutes. I won&#x27;t do it for another couple days, yep. Back to working on the music project. Reserching drums is so fun WINK WINK. I mean it is kinda hard.</p>
<p>After some research later, I played video games for 10 minutes. It was the new NeedForSpeed game. Unbound I think. Anyways, I am researching caps. I wan&#x27;t a nice cap, so I will invest it one to last a while. It is currently 5:30, I spent some time reading a book. The book had pictures, thats besides the point though. I was exercising while reading the book. It is an efeicaent way to do things. I think. I will go back to browsing for hats. Currently 6:30, I looked the caps and found a nice one. I want to embrioder some flowers and a halo on it though. So anyways, I will work on my music homework.</p>
<p>Currently 7:05, I wasted 30 minutes just agruing. Anyways, I will do some work now? No, I just talked with my dad about what hat I should get. I am very tired, why? Because looking at caps for 2 hours is not a good use of time or a fun one. But, I did find out some things from our conversation. I will do some work now. Currently 7:36.</p>
<p>I finished the music project. But I have one more to do, huh. Well I just checked, apparently I have not turned in any assignment in music class. Have I just been completing the work without handing it in? Probably, but how? I thought for sure I turned them in. Even homework from last year was considered not turned in. What&#x27;s going on? Is it glitching? Or did I really not turn in any assignment. Wow, I just turned them all in and wrote to my teacher. I hope I won&#x27;t (haven&#x27;t) got marks off for turning it (all) late.</p>
<p>Anyways, all that said and done. It is 8:00, I will take a five minute break. Then finish the 3rd music homework. I&#x27;ve already done the first and second, all that is left is the third. Currently 8:07, I took a little longer than I thought. Back to work, crying emoji. I decided to research the Circua and the _____ .</p>

<p>I&#x27;ve decided to spend the entire day with my family. It was selfish of me to think about doing work only. I don&#x27;t even see their faces most of the day. This cannot go on, for my health and theirs. I&#x27;m fine though. Anyways, currently 7:53. I will go spend time with them. Currently 10:50, it was a mistake. I feel not great, I will study.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Anyways, I will study. Currently 11:00, I feel better. I will just do some homework.</p>
<p>&quot;All the money in the world couldn&#x27;t buy back those days&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your life will surely change&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You could&#x27;ve done anything if you wanted&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Things fall into place&quot;</p>
<p>Anyways, I did some research. I will vacum the house. I vacumed for a bit, then finished the last music homework. I am done, nice. What now? Currently 11:51, I will relax till 12:00.</p>
<p>It is 3:31, what happened? I relaxed till 12:05, then I don&#x27;t remember what happened. Then I ate lunch, it took some time because I was watching tv. Then, I went to the mall with my family. I bought myself a nice cap. It is brown and blue, I am super excited and happy. My brother spotted the largest stuffed animal I&#x27;ve seen, then asked my parents. They said no, he is not used to hearing no. He started crying.</p>
<p>The reason my parents said no was simple, he does not take care of his stuffed animals. He has like 30 stuffed animals, none does he take any care of. Anyways, the cap I bought was 73 CAD, so 54 USD. It might be a little pricy, but, I will wear this for years. My last cap was from the same company, I wore it for two years, it recently broke. I know, &quot;Your family got you a nice cap! Why are you unhappy&quot;. Well see, you don&#x27;t get it. &quot;No you don&#x27;t get it, your privilged!&quot; Yes, yes I am. So? Can I not be unhappy? &quot;You have money, a roof over your head and food!&quot; Yes I do, and I am not unhappy. I&#x27;m angry, at dumb misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to work. I did not get back to work. I played monopoly with my family for 45 minutes. Then just watched something with my younger brother. I was winning by the way. Anyways, I will finish some geography work. I don&#x27;t need to do it, but I want to? I have nothing to do, I mean I could excersice, but I think it is bad for my back?</p>
<p>OK, so! When I was 10 or 11, someone pulled the chair from under me. Zander H, Im sure you know who you are. For him, it was just a prank. For me, it was constant suffering for the past 2 years. I can&#x27;t sleep at night because it keeps me awake. You as*****. &quot;It&#x27;s just a prank!&quot; <em><strong>Breaks my spine in two</strong></em></p>
<p>It was not my spine, but one of my back muscles that tore or something. So it hurts when I use my back, I feel like an old man. The docters said &quot;You have chronic back pain!&quot; Shut up, that just means my back has been hurting for a while. Tell me how to fix it. They said, &quot;do these exersices&quot;. I have been doing them sometimes, not enough I suppose. Sometimes it hurts so much I can&#x27;t walk. But it is fine, was it my mistake not paying attention? It has been so long yet it has not healed, why? I have not <strong>let</strong> it heal properly. But I can not let it heal properly, I have school. Things I need to do, everything requires your back. But it already happened, but why me? Ah whatever, I am doing great. A little pain is nothing.</p>
<p>Back to doing whatever, currently 6:00. I did not do work, I just did random things and goofed off, I regret it. Currently 6:30-ish. I will study some math things.</p>
<p>Scatter plots, they are plots with scatterd data. They usually represent two values/catagories. Like:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr31-3a82109231b67763d13e6407ffa5653e.png" width="1382" height="848" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Screenshot of something I made in google slides</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the x-axis is the age of people, and the y-axis is how much apples they eat yearly. Solve the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is range of apples eaten on the plot? (From _ to _)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>what is the max amount of apples any age group eats? (__ because ____)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the range is from 0 to 40 on the graph, because no age group ON the graph eats more than 40. Or less than 0, so 0 to 40. So then what is the max? It would be the highest amount of yearly apples eaten from the &quot;age&quot;s. So that would be 40, as forty is the max amount of apples eaten, it is the max. Therefore the MIN/minimum, would be 0, it is the least &quot;apples eaten&quot; per age. These questions were not very difficult, you can eyeball them to find the answer. These are just examples. This graph is a positively kinda-strong linear graph. It is positive as the (lines) slope is positive. It is kinda strong because the values or plots are not very far from each other. Somewhat, and it is a linear graph. It goes in a straight line-ish, but the values dont always decend. I&#x27;m not quite sure of this myself, this why I am learning. The values increase as the other one increase. A non-linear graph is where when one &quot;axis&quot; increases, the other decreases. Like if x is 3, then y would be &quot;10 - x/2&quot;. This would cause the higher the &quot;x&quot;, the lower the &quot;y&quot;. Wait no that does not seem right! I am not sure of anything this point. I will try to understand it and write it down.</p>
<p>Anyways, I will continue to learn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are some outliers in the graph above? (x,y and x,y)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some outliers would be (50,20) and (5,15). They are a little different from the rest, they are not very different. But enough for me personlly to consider them outliers of sorts. Currently 7:39, what am I doing? Trying to learn things, but I am not feeling it. I shall exersice, that should make me feel better. I did not, I ate dinner. It is 9:00, the cap I bought has the New York Yankees logo on it. I like the yankees, they stand for tradition, excellence and winning. They won the most championships of all MLB teams. They have 27 world series. They have not won since 2009, but they will soon.</p>
<p>Slept</p>

<p>I went to school, I looked very cool in my brand new cap. I feel short today, why? Maybe my posture for the last two days aren&#x27;t great. I was playing basketball when one of my friends jumped up and elbowed me in the eye, it hurts. It is fine though, my team mate threw the ball at me. It hit my pink straight, it is swollen. But I&#x27;ll be fine. These things happen, I will not let it ruin my day. It won&#x27;t ruin my day, I would? If I let it ruin my day, that means I ruined my day. It is only my own fault if I let it ruin my day. Of course things happen and your day can be ruined, but if the thing that happend was so bad. The day is not ruined, il will be remembered. I don&#x27;t know how to explain this, but this phrase is only applicable if the thing that happened today was not over the top bad. Otherwise it is not ruined, but simplily a bad day? Never mind, no use racking my head over such a small thing. I got invited to the MAA, Math Fest... Screw that.</p>
<p>I heard crying and screaming coming from next door. I didn&#x27;t know what was going on so I ignored it. I then looked out my window and saw my neighbor crying and asking for help from people passing by. This was after some time, a man driving past parked and got out to help. I then recognized her as my neighbor, and this is also when I relised she was asking for help. She was asking people to help her, as her baby was trapped. I then went with my dad to help her. When we got outside, the situation was resolved. The man who came to help, did something, and got the baby out. There was a loud thud we heard as we put jackets on. The man must have broken a door or cuboard to save the child. It&#x27;s scary, a mother in tears afraid of losing her child. Her husband was probably at work. What if... I&#x27;m glad the man passing by helped, he is a true man. As her neighbors, we only relised later. I heard muffled crying till it got louder and I took heed. It was my own fault of not coming to help sooner. Luckily the man helped and it resolved quickly. I can only imagine how hard it is to take care of kids alone. For a good chunk of the day, she is the only one watching her little kids. I... hmm. Im glad she got her kid. My heart sank when I relised what she was saying. It is a strange feeling, being helpless to what happens. Well, anyways.</p>
<p>As I was saying previously, I got invited to the MAA math fest. It seems cool, only thing is. I am in canada, not the US. So yeah, probably not going there. But why was I even invited? I wonder, they even knew my name. &quot;Hi shaurya, exitement is building for MAA...&quot; Yeah, well I doubt I will go. What now? I can do anything, so I choose to relax for a little bit.</p>
<p>Currently 5:15, I regret wasting time. I shall exersice, how easy is it for me to regret. But not stop myself from just wasting time. I will exersice then return to work.</p>
<p>Currently 6:00-ish. I excersied and filled my water bottle. I will study, what will I study? I... will... study some math things. Yeah, math. Currently 6:20, I went downstairs to where my family was. My younger brother is, difficult. My parents never tell him anything, but when I do I get punished. They think I hate my younger brother, I don&#x27;t, I hate how he acts. &quot;He is 7 years old!&quot; Yes he is, but I have high expectations. I seem, no I, huh. My expectations are completely reasonable. But as this is a blog, not a dairy I will leave it at that. I wan&#x27;t him to become a better person, but he is annoying, &quot;You find anything he does annoying&quot;. I guess I do, I&#x27;m not sure what to do. I am not dumb, I&#x27;m not a movie teen. This is real life, if my brother is annoying, or not doing good. I should <del>fix</del> tell him how to be better, but I. Never mind. Back to work.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not saying anything bad, he is good. Back to work. I just figured out how to decern functions from graphs. Such as:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr32-426d312b81cc6c843d8bf87ecf6054a7.png" width="1602" height="1030" class="img_ev3q">

<blockquote>
<p>Solve the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is f(5)? ( It is __ because ___)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is f(-4)?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is f(-7)?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is f(0)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, what does this even mean? f(?) just means, what is the corresposing y to the &quot;?&quot; x. So if x in f(x) is say 5. Then the corresponding y would be -1. Why? So if x is 5, then according to the graph, y is -1. It is simple, so understand it like this.</p>
<p>f(x) = y</p>
<p>So f(5) would be -1, since y in this case is -1. Get it? I did not know this, untill I just guessed and got the problem in khanacedemy right. So anyways, lets solve the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>f(5) = -1 because it is the y of the function</li>
<li>f(-4) = -2 because it is the y of the function</li>
<li>f(-7) = 1 because it is the y of the function</li>
<li>f(0) = -6 because it is the y of the function</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, the y is equal to those answers because it is the y of the function. Makes sense right? Yep, anyways. You can visually see how the dots have an x and y value. So the function is just asking what is the y of the dot with an x value of &quot;?&quot;. Get it? Back to work. Currently 7:15, I spent some time understanding this concept. It could have taken a shorter amount of time I guess, but at least I fully understand it. I could have gone faster I guess, I will try to do more.</p>
<p>Just saw some new way to do graphs:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus logo" src="/assets/images/scr33-5401ca2d3f5f29d00970108745cc836b.png" width="1602" height="1030" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Screenshot of something I made in google slides</em></p>
<p>So, lets figure this out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Solve the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is f(3) red? ( It is __ because ___)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is f(-1) blue?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is f(5) red?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is f(-3) pink?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lets do this. So what is this graph? Imagine this as just a bunch of dots that look like a line, so what is the function x for one of the y&#x27;s? It would just be whatever y correspods to the x is f(x). Same as the other graph, just looks different. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>f(3) red = 2 because that is the y of the red&#x27;s x</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>f(-1) blue = 1 because that is the y of the blue&#x27;s x</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>f(5) red = 0 because that is the y of the red&#x27;s x</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>f(-3) pink = -4 because that is the y of the pink&#x27;s x</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, so in this case I specified the line color. This should be self explanitory. But just in case I will explain, the lines are just a bunch of values on the x-y plane. So if asked what the y is of an x value, you would know by looking at the graph. Simple. Anyways, it is 7:40. I will continue to learn. I just read about function notation, why does this exist? It is needlessly hard. But, it is still doable. So, according to the graph above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Solve the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is 3 * red(-2) + 3 + 7 * blue(-1)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do we even start this? I just quickly made it up, so how I would solve it would be:</p>
<p>Finding the function of each &quot;line&quot;, I found out that you can just write red or blue instead of &quot;f&quot; in &quot;f(x)&quot;. So I did that to make it look simpler. Anyways, solve.</p>
<ul>
<li>3 * red(-2) + 3 + 7 * blue(-1)</li>
<li>3 * 3 + 3 + 7 * 1</li>
<li>9 + 10 * 1</li>
<li>19 * 1</li>
<li>19</li>
</ul>
<p>But what is the correct way? This, this is the correct way. I am 90% sure, you can try it out yourself if you arent sure. But anyways, back to work. You really have to be careful, of the negative numbers. They can screw the problem up if you don&#x27;t write the negative sign.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is 2 + 7 * pink(3) - 6 + 5 * red(6)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do we solve this? We simplify it, then solve it. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 + 7 * pink(3) - 6 + 5 * red(6)</li>
<li>2 + 7 * -2 - 6 + 5 * -1</li>
<li>2 + -14 - 6 + -5</li>
<li>2 + -20 + -5</li>
<li>2 + -25</li>
<li>-25 + 2</li>
<li>-23</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this correct? Yes, yes it is. So yeah, the negative&#x27;s can be tricky if you forget them. It was warm today, it was pretty cool. I was sweating in class. I will go play games, I studied and feel better.</p>
<p><em>Currently the next day, I played minecraft, ate dinner, then slpet.</em></p>

<p>I will go to school now.</p>
<p>Got back, I relise now that nobody is your friend. I mean, I&#x27;m doing fine. But some girls next me were being mean to each other, they were telling each other that the other one has no real friends. Is there anyone in canada who is a real friend to me? No, I just have friends/acquaintances. Friends aren&#x27;t people you can depend on, they are merely people you know. Thinking back to when I was in california, I had real friends. But not very many of them, you don&#x27;t need very many, you only need to be around trustworthy people. I&#x27;m a bad person, I&#x27;m always neutral. A kid walked by my window and waved at me, I didn&#x27;t wave back. I feel guilty, my chest aches. But why? I did not wave back, I should have. I&#x27;m almost never going to have something like that happen to me. This little kid, I should have waved. I feel torn, am I a bad person? I always think I&#x27;m a good person, but if anything, I&#x27;m a bystander to most things. I always love helping people, but sometimes I don&#x27;t. This is what life is about, choices. You either hate yourself or love yourself, that or you just don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>I talk too much? I don&#x27;t relise things? I&#x27;m naieve? No one is truly your friend, only family cares about you. This feeling is not great. I&#x27;m learning as I go, I feel weak right now. Why? Because I feel like a bad person. Why? Because I&#x27;m not good enough. Why? Because I feel pathetic, that I&#x27;m not a great person. I consider myself a good person, am I not? No one is truly good.</p>
<p>Only thing we can do is keep walking. Life can be cruel sometimes. What I feel is complicated, I feel... bad. Why write here about it? I don&#x27;t know, this is a blog. You can keep your head down and keep walking in life. Or you could do something. So what do I do? I have it good, I&#x27;m tall. &quot;Height isn&#x27;t everything!&quot; Yeah, it&#x27;s not. But strength is just as important and intellect. No one cares about you? Family does, only family will. Family doesn&#x27;t? They probably do, why else are you alive? We try to find meaning to our existence&#x27;s, but why? We&#x27;re scared of being a meaningless existence? We want a porpose? I wan&#x27;t a porpose? Yes, I do, my porpose right now is to study and take care of my family. Be selfish? Only look out for yourself and family? Family is the only thing that matters? The world is cruel. Only if you relise it is.</p>
<p>Aa, my lack of sleep is getting to me. I haven&#x27;t selpt properly in the past couple days. My pain keeps me awake. I&#x27;m tired, but I can&#x27;t sleep. I have things to do. Some people&#x27;s logic is if you can&#x27;t be a good person, be a bad one. That&#x27;s not right, right? Whatever, I should be thankful. I&#x27;m alive and thirving.</p>
<p>I will relax for 30 minutes. Currently 5:00. Clear my head y&#x27;know. Currently 5:45, I feel worse. I&#x27;m a terrible person. But I can be better. I will exersice, for I don&#x27;t know how long. I think the reason why I can&#x27;t sleep at night it because I don&#x27;t let my back heal. And exersicing just makes it worse? I don&#x27;t know, I will be back at 6:15.</p>
<p><em>Currently tomorrow, I exercised till 6:05, then my dad called for me. I wen&#x27;t and we discussed SAT plans and prep till 7:30. I then played minecraft and ate dinner. Slep?</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="febuary-28th-️">Febuary 28th 🌧️<a href="#febuary-28th-️" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Febuary 28th 🌧️" title="Direct link to Febuary 28th 🌧️">​</a></h3>
<p>I slept a little last night. I was awake till 3:00, then I tried to relax and not think of anything. That did not work, it started raining so heavily that I got scared. The wind was so loud it hurt my ears even inside the house. Anyways, I did something and fell asleep. Nice.</p>
<p>Now 7:31 AM. I am looking outside and see that everything is wet. It was a thunderstorm last night, rain, thunder, and wind. I will go to school now.</p>
<p>Currently 4:30-ish (4:27). I am back, I had a good day at school. I hung out with my friends, and had a good time. You can have fun with friends, you just can&#x27;t count on them. Those you can count on are true friends, people you enjoy hanging out with are merely friends. People you love should be your family. If you hate them, something is wrong. Anyways, I will relax for a little bit.</p>
<p>While I am relaxing, I talked to my mother a bit about highschool. I need to choose my courses. Currently 4:44, I am gonna relax for five more minutes then study english. There is mah and english on the SAT&#x27;s. Currently 5:00, I wasted some time (sadly) and then did 20 pushups. I think I&#x27;m getting better. Anyways, I will now study english. I did not study english, instead I am doing my homework. I will finish a part of it then study english. I wrote 1050 letters just now, not bad at all. Holy cow outside my window is pure white, it is a blizzard outside. I will take a picture. I took some, I will not show you all till later in my life. Why? I don&#x27;t feel like giving everyone my location, anyways, I will now study english.</p>
<p>Side note, there was a thunderstorm last night, there was so much rain and wind. Then this morning is was super sunny and warm. And right now it is super snowy. The weather here is insane, no it is unbelievable. Anyways, back to work. I found out that the reading and writing portion of the SAT includs graphs. These graphs have info, you need to make an inference or answer a question with this info. Not in the case of numbers or words. I will talk with my parents about highschool. Currently 6:00.</p>
<p>Currently 6:50, I will set a timer and start a SAT practice test for READING AND WRITING. Currently 7:22, I spent 30 minutes on the practice test. I got 32 questions done, my father said there were only 27 questions. What did I answer then? I will come back to this, right now I will rest/relax for a bit. I just checked, there were 33 questions. I would have finished if I had gotten my materials ready before hand. I put the timer on, then turned on the lights, closed the blinds, and found a notebook and pen. Dang it, I should prepare more next time. But this just means that it is doable, now all that is next is to find out if I got any correct.</p>
<p>I got 22/32 questions answered. Dang it, thats like a 68 percent. I think, anyways, I will show my dad. He said it was a good score for a lazy afternoon. I mean my first time doing a reading and writitng practice test, I expected to get everything right. But I guess not, anyways. I will do something.</p>
<p>Currently 8:19, I spent some time working on a story me and my classmate Anannd are working on. It is about a man who wakes up in the future, but to his dismay, everyone is gone. Right? Anyways, I will take a break of taking a break, that means I will work on homework. Why not? I don&#x27;t have anything to do, I could exersice, but my form is bad so it hurts my back.</p>
<p><em>Next day, forgot what I did, I think I ate dinner and played minecraft. Ah, I did 20 pushups yesterday. After wasting some time of course, then ate and played minecraft. I had a good (not really) nights rest, maybe because I did not do anything to hurt my back? I don&#x27;t know, but anyways, I will continue working on feb 29th.</em></p>

<p>Currently 5:30, how did we get here? I came back from school walking, then I talked with my parents for a bit. Afterwards I played minecraft, then watched some Tv show. And right now I will... <em>thinking</em> homework, then studying. By the way, it will be march soon. Wow, that is crazy. Currently 6:09, I have gotten good progress done and will continue. I just wrote 3,346 characters, nice. I am done with my history homework. I learned about many things, in this short time, I learned more than I have about history in a year. I extensively researched and wrote about black history, it was useful. Currently 6:30, I will turn in the asignment and relax for little. I have french homework, ahhhh I hate french. Not because the langauge is bad, I like the language, but because of the work. It is so tedious, but I have to do it. I mean that&#x27;s how all homework is, I can&#x27;t be complaining. I will take a break then do it. <em>Ten minutes later</em>. . . Currently exactly 6:40, I will finish my french work as it is due tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Currently 7:00-ish, I finsihed the french work, nothing is diffiult it you put effort. That sounds like advice, but I put in some effort to get it done and actually finished an am happy with what I did. I will take a break. Currently 7:40, I just wasted time, I regret it. I will now study for a bit. English in Khanacedemy.</p>
<p>How you answer a reading question is by looking at the data, be that in word form or in a graph. You &quot;read&quot; the graph, or read the text to solve the question. Graphs will most likely include more data than necessary, so you need to only focus on the important parts, while still having an understanding of what the problem is asking and where that info is to be found. Pick the correct answer based on what you think, double check too. You can make a summary of the info, then compare it against the multipl choice answers if there are any, in case of writing, just write what you know based from the data (quantitive or qualitive).</p>
<p>According to Terence Tao on Khanacedemy, they said this a year ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;. . .the new digital sat will only contain single para questions.&quot;</p>

<p>This is great, now we wont have to read long stories and answer questions, but at the same time this leads to the questions of:</p>

<li>Is it harder? (probably)</li>
<li>Is it going to require lots of thinking? (yes)</li>
</ul>
<p>These mini stories, having lots of them would mean reading/learing something new and being asked to summarize it or answer a question on it. Would that not be difficult? Hopping from one question to the next, with each having little to no correlation to the past or future ones? That would probably test us more than just summarizing a long story, it is effective but I mean it is probably harder? (Im not sure, I think so though, the average reading comprehension level has gone up since then anyways). Yup.</p>
<p>Comment from me on Khanacedemy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;So if the question is asking which answer is false, and they give a multiple choice of some possible answers, then they want you to find which one is false. As in not a correct answer to the problem, it sounds iffy but just encountering these types of questions will further your understanding. So 1 is true, 2 is true, 3 is false, and 4 is true. Which one is false? The third one, why? Because it is false, and not true. This is what I think.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Am I correct? In my personal views, yes. But correct me if I&#x27;m worng, the false one is correct if the questions is asking which is false. As in not true. Yep. What I&#x27;ve learned is that the answer to a mutliple choice <strong>Reading and Writing</strong> question may be correct, but not relevent to the topic that is asked. So:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John like cats, and John has a dog, he wants a cat too. His mother said no, he is sad. The dog is very soft and his mom pets the dog, his mother is very nice. She knows that it will be too much of a hassel. And his mom knows that cats are cute. The reason why John wants a cat, is because ______ !</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fill in the blank with one:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>John likes cats</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>He has a dog</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>The dog is soft</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Cats are cute</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So, what did you pick? I just made this up but it summerizes what I was saying, not in the quote but in the paragraph beneath. The correct answer was 1, but why? Because the text clearly states that John likes cats. The other choices are correct, but irrelevent to the blank. This next one is to be an example of the quote I put in of myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You go to the grocery store, the store has many people. The store is very good, it has lot&#x27;s of wares and is a nice place. It is one story tall and has a pond in front of it. You love going to the store, but don&#x27;t come often. You often find youself just browsing without getting anything. Sometimes you buy food, you don&#x27;t want to starve after all. You are tired, so you head back home. You then watch Tv and go to sleep. This was a good day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which of the following is false:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>You watched tv</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>The store is one story tall</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>You go there often</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>There is a pond in front of it</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>What did you pick? This was another short story I just made up. The correct answer was 3, why? Because it states in the text that you do not go there often. That is why is is correct, even though it is false. Get it? Currently 8:30, I will go eat dinner. It will be March tomorrow. Wow.</p>
<p><em>Currently the next day, I ate dinner then &quot;slept&quot; right away.</em></p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div
